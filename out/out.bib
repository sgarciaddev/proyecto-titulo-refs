	abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) is an advanced technology that provides access to predictive resources and data sharing. The cloud environment represents the right type regarding cloud usage model ownership, size, and rights to access. It introduces the scope and nature of cloud computing. In recent times, all processes are fed into the system for which consumer data and cache size are required. One of the most security issues in the cloud environment is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, responsible for cloud server overloading. This proposed system ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) Maximum Multifactor Dimensionality Posteriori Method (ID3-MMDP) is used to overcome the drawback and a relatively simple way to execute and for the detection of (DDoS) attack. First, the proposed ID3-MMDP method calls for the resources of the cloud platform and then implements the attack detection technology based on information entropy to detect DDoS attacks. Since because the entropy value can show the discrete or aggregated characteristics of the current data set, it can be used for the detection of abnormal data flow, User-uploaded data, ID3-MMDP system checks and read risk measurement and processing, bug rating file size changes, or file name changes and changes in the format design of the data size entropy value. Unique properties can be used whenever the program approaches any data error to detect abnormal data services. Finally, the experiment also verifies the DDoS attack detection capability algorithm.},

Availability is considered as the important security requirement for facilitating disruptive utilization of on-demand cloud service for diverse client applications. Seamless services of clouds are hindered by Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in a cloud computing environment. In this paper, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based DDoS attack mitigation scheme is propounded for handling the impacts of DDoS attacks in fog-assisted cloud computing environment. In the proposed scheme, Software Defined Network (SDN) is utilized for deploying defense module in the SDN controller for the purpose of identifying anomalous characteristics of DDoS attack in transport or network layer. It aids in filtering and forwarding legitimate packets by performing network traffic analysis while circumventing attacks caused by infected packets.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most common and effective attack types aiming to deny or limit services. To mitigate the problem of DDoS attacks to online cloud services, anomaly detection methods of user access behaviors are widely used to defend against attackers. We pay particular attention to anomaly detection methods after reviewing recent development efforts of application-layer DDoS detection techniques for cloud storage systems. Inspired by a dynamic analysis of access behavior changes in active users, we propose a DDoS anomaly detection model to discover DDoS attack sources by diagnosing users' similarities. The overarching goal of our solution is to pinpoint DDoS by monitoring the similarity of active users around existing users at a low cost. This goal is achieved by our proposed model embracing the following key steps. First, a sample user set is originated. Then, the active users' requests are tracked to gauge similarity measures between each active user and sample users. Finally, if the deviation of similarity exceeds the prescribed thresholds, detected users will be flagged as anomalous ones.},

	abstract = {In the recent years, security is the major concern in cloud computing. One of the major security threats to the cloud is distributed denial of service (DDoS). This DDoS attacks results in data corruption, losing of sensitive information and leads to denial of cloud service. To overcome the drawbacks of security, we proposed the behaviour-based DDoS detection algorithm that is based on the behaviour of the user which generates the traffic. The proposed work is divided into two phases which can be executed in parallel. In general, the hackers or illegitimate user floods the traffic and uses more bandwidth. In first phase, the analysis of the dynamic traffic and effectively differentiating the genuine traffic and attacker's traffic is done in the proposed algorithm. The packet analyzer is responsible to identify the genuine packets from the flooding traffic. In second phase, the CPU utilization is monitored and the process consuming more CPU power or the source is illegitimate, the process is rejected. The simulation is carried by using the OPNET simulator. The simulation results are tested with three different scenarios. It is proved that the proposed model has efficient response time and it has better efficiency in DDoS prone zones.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have become one of the most serious threats to cloud network. Currently, most of the research on DDoS attack mitigation focuses on DDoS traffic detection without considering further analysis (e.g., fine-grained classification of mixed attack traffic). By further analysis, we can provide more support for attack interception and traceback. This paper proposes a new abnormal traffic classification method A3DC (Autoencoder-based Three-Dimensional Linear Cluster) to overcome the difficulty of fine-grained distinguishing DDoS attacks under a small amount of labelled training data in cloud network environment. Based on a novel proposed 3D cluster algorithm, A3DC method consisting of three stages, which are data normalization preprocessing, autoencoder downscaling, and data clustering, is designed. The experimental results on the public data set show that A3DC is significantly superior to existing methods in terms of mixed attack traffic classification and is able to obtain higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate in DDoS attack detection.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has revolutionized the information technology landscape, offering businesses the flexibility to adapt to diverse business models without the need for costly on-site servers and network infrastructure. A recent survey reveals that 95\% of enterprises have already embraced cloud technology, with 79\% of their workloads migrating to cloud environments. However, the deployment of cloud technology introduces significant cybersecurity risks, including network security vulnerabilities, data access control challenges, and the ever-looming threat of cyber-attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which pose substantial risks to both cloud and network security. While Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have traditionally been employed for DDoS attack detection, prior studies have been constrained by various limitations. In response to these challenges, we present an innovative machine learning approach for DDoS cloud detection, known as the Bayesian-based Convolutional Neural Network (BaysCNN) model. Leveraging the CICDDoS2019 dataset, which encompasses 88 features, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Our BaysCNN model comprises 19 layers of analysis, forming the basis for training and validation. Our experimental findings conclusively demonstrate that the BaysCNN model significantly enhances the accuracy of DDoS cloud detection, achieving an impressive average accuracy rate of 99.66\% across 13 multi-class attacks. To further elevate the model's performance, we introduce the Data Fusion BaysFusCNN approach, encompassing 27 layers. By leveraging Bayesian methods to estimate uncertainties and integrating features from multiple sources, this approach attains an even higher average accuracy of 99.79\% across the same 13 multi-class attacks. Our proposed methodology not only offers valuable insights for the development of robust machine learning-based intrusion detection systems but also enhances the reliability and scalability of IDS in cloud computing environments. This empowers organizations to proactively mitigate security risks and fortify their defenses against malicious cyber-attacks.},

	abstract = {The integration of cloud computing with Software Defined Networking (SDN) addresses several challenges of a typical cloud infrastructure such as complex inter-networking, data collection, fast response, etc. Though SDN-based cloud opens new opportunities, the SDN controller may itself become vulnerable to several attacks. The unique features of SDN are used by the attackers to implement the severe Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Several approaches are available in literature to defend against the traditional DDoS flooding attacks in SDN-cloud. To elude the detection systems, attackers try to employ the cultivated attack strategies. Such sophisticated DDoS attack strategies are implemented by generating low-rate attack traffic. The most common type of Low-Rate DDoS (LR-DDoS) attack is the Shrew attack. The existing approaches are not capable to detect, mitigate, and traceback such attacks. Thus, this work discusses a new mechanism which not only detects and mitigates the shrew attack but traces back the location of the attack sources as well. The attack is detected using the information entropy variations, and the attack sources are traced-back using the deterministic packet marking scheme. The experiments are performed in a real SDN-cloud scenario, and the experimental results show that the approach requires 1 packet and 8.27 packets on an average to locate the bots and attackers respectively. The approach detects and traces back the attack sources in between 14.45 ms to 10.02 s and provides 97.6\% accuracy.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing would be an easy method to obtain services, resources and applications from any location on the internet. In the future of data generation, it is an unavoidable conclusion. Despite its many attractive properties, the cloud is vulnerable to a variety of attacks. One such well-known attack that emphasizes the availability of amenities is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). A DDoS assault overwhelms the server with massive quantities of regular or intermittent traffic. It compromises with the cloud servers' services and makes it harder to reply to legitimate users of the cloud. A monitoring system with correct resource scaling approach should be created to regulate and monitor the DDoS assault. The network is overwhelmed with excessive traffic of significant resource usage requests during the attack, resulting in the denial of needed services to genuine users. In this research, a unique way to the analyze resources used by the cloud users, lowering of the resources consumed is done when the network is overburdened with excessive traffic, and the dynamic cloud load balancing algorithm DCLB (Dynamic Cloud Load Balancing) is used to balance the overhead towards the server. The core premise is to monitor traffic using the fuzzy logic approach, which employs different traffic parameters in conjunction with various built in measured to recognize the DDoS attack traffic in the network. Finally, the proposed method shows a 93\% of average detection rate when compared to the existing model. This method is a unique attempt to comprehend the importance of DDoS mitigation techniques as well as good resource management during an attack and analysis of the.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has very attractive features like elastic, on demand and fully managed computer system resources and services. However, due to its distributed and dynamic nature as well as vulnerabilities in virtualization implementation, the cloud environment is prone to various cyber-attacks and security issues related to cloud model. Some of them are inability to access data coming to and from cloud service, theft and misuse of data hosted, no control over sensitive data access, advance threats like malware injection attack, wrapping attacks, virtual machine escape, distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) etc. DDoS is one of the notorious attack. Despite a number of available potential solutions for the detection of DDoS attacks, the increasing frequency and potency of recent attacks and the constantly evolving attack vectors, necessitate the development of improved detection approaches. This article proposes a novel architecture that combines a well posed stacked sparse AutoEncoder (AE) for feature learning with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for classification of network traffic into benign traffic and DDoS attack traffic. AE and DNN are optimized for detection of DDoS attacks by tuning the parameters using appropriately designed techniques. The improvements suggested in this article lead to low reconstruction error, prevent exploding and vanishing gradients, and lead to smaller network which avoids overfitting. A comparative analysis of the proposed approach with ten state-of-the-art approaches using performance metrics-detection accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, has been conducted. Experiments have been performed on CICIDS2017 and NSL-KDD standard datasets for validation. Proposed approach outperforms existing approaches over the NSL-KDD dataset and yields competitive results over the CICIDS2017 dataset.},

	abstract = {As the cloud systems gain in popularity, they suffer from cyber attacks. One of the most notorious cyber attacks is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which aims to drain the system resources so that the system becomes unresponsive to the genuine users. DDoS attack and defense essentially revolve around resource competition. Many efforts have been made from the perspective of resource investment and management. However, these defending schemes assume that the resources available to defend the attacks are unlimited without taking the financial cost into account. Such coarse-grained defense strategies could cause the problem of resource overprovisioning, which would incur unwanted extra costs to the defender. To tackle this issue, we systematically investigate the problem and propose a birth-death-based fine-grained resource management mechanism, which can both scale in/out and scale down/up. That is, the proposed mechanism adaptively selects the optimal resource leasing mode for cloud service customers so that they can defeat the DDoS attack with minimal financial cost. Extensive analyses and empirical data-based experiments are conducted. The results show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. Comparing to existing work, our proposal can averagely save 53.58\% (up to 93.75\%) of the cost for the attack defense.},

	abstract = {Fog computing (FC) is a contemporary computing paradigm that gives additional support to cloud environment by carrying out some local data analysis in edge of the devices, facilitating networking, computing, infrastructure and storage support as backbone for end user computing. Still enterprises are not convinced to use this as security and privacy are most of the open and challenging issues. Availability among the security requirements is the one which is about rendering on demand service to different client applications without any disruptions. It can often be demolished by Denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in fog and cloud computing environment. In this paper we propose a novel Source based DDoS defence mechanism which can be used in fog environment as well as the cloud environment to mitigate DDoS attacks. It makes use of Software Defined Network (SDN) to deploy the DDoS defender module at SDN controller to detect the anomalous behavior of DDoS attacks in Network/Transport level. The proposed work provides deep learning (DL) based detection method which makes use of the network traffic analysis mechanisms to filter and forward the legitimate packets to the server and can block the infected packets to cause further attacks.

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is rising exponentially and creates a severe threat to security. Generally, the DDoS attack may appear uncomplicated but they are hard to prevent and considered as one of the most significant cybersecurity issues. Hence, addressing against DDoS attacks turns out to be imperative. The major goal of this paper involves the optimal detection of data samples as normal data samples and malicious/ attacked data samples. This paper proposes a security algorithm against DDoS attacks by employing four significant phases namely the Database training phase, Data pre-processing phase, Feature selection phase and Classification phase. Initially, the data samples are to be trained before using it for attack detection. Later, the sample group is created for every file and the data samples are pre-processed in the data pre-processing phase. Secondly, in feature selection phase, the selected features are optimized by employing kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to obtain optimal features. Later, in the classification phase, a support vector machine-based discrete elephant herding optimization (SVM-DEHO) classifier is utilized to detect the data sample as normal data and attacked or malicious data. Finally, the proposed approach is examined for four different databases namely NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, ISCX ID and CIC-IDS2017 databases respectively. The experimental analyses are performed for various simulation metrics and the outcome reveals that the detection system performances are high using SVM-DEHO approach than other approaches.},

	abstract = {The DDoS attack nullifies the data availability in cloud by primarily exploiting the security vulnerabilities of the network protocol and cloud services. The emergence of deep-learning based defense systems have delivered outstanding success in handling the DDoS attacks. However, the deep-learning based systems relies on having similar attack features during training and evaluation. In this paper, we propose a domain adversarial defense (DAD) system to reduce the domain mismatch and generalize the model to handle real-time attacks in cloud. Two novel strategies are applied into our proposed DAD system. 1) Latent feature extractor to extract domain invariant features across multiple domains. 2) Adversarial training algorithm to perform unsupervised adaptation over a defense system using real-time attack samples. The capability of the DAD model is empirically substantiated across four datasets to understand its effectiveness across both known and unknown attacks. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed DAD model achieves substantial improvements with minimum overhead, reduced latency and better efficacy over existing defense mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Nowadays Mobile Health (also termed as m-Health) is an essential component of the healthcare sector. The m-healthcare uses different types of digitized devices (laptops, smart phones, tablets) to transfer patient runtime data very quickly among the different internetworking channels. The architecture of the m-health system is completely dependent on the centralized cloud computing system. Cloud computing architecture suffers from various attacks, which leads to the unavailability of data at runtime. The paper concentrates on the most vulnerable DDoS attack, which disrupts the network by unauthorized requests and breaks the reliability of the system. In the research paper, the authors have designed the four-layers m-healthcare architecture. An innovative DDoS recognition approach is proposed to easily identify the attacks in the system. The deterrence approaches are also analysed and experimented with the help of virtualized cloud-based software environment. The result section is progressed with the use of performance metrics, and analysis of maximum and mean value of DDoS attack success rate is also part of the research work.},

	abstract = {Mobile Health (m-Health) has become an integral part of modern healthcare, utilizing digital devices like laptops, smart phones, and tablets to facilitate the rapid exchange of real-time patient data through interconnected channels. However, the reliance on centralized cloud computing in m-health systems introduces potential security vulnerabilities. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant risk, capable of disrupting networks and compromising system reliability. The research paper addresses the vulnerability of m-healthcare systems to DDoS attacks and proposes a four-layered architecture to enhance security measures. The focus on recognizing and identifying DDoS attacks within the system is crucial for early detection and prevention of potential harm. Moreover, the exploration of different deterrence approaches in a virtualized cloud-based environment allows for a comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness. The analysis of performance metrics, particularly the maximum and mean values of DDoS attack success rates, provides valuable insights into the efficacy of the proposed architecture and defense mechanisms. This information will undoubtedly assist in refining and strengthening the system's security measures to mitigate the impact of potential DDoS attacks. Overall, the research paper delves into a critical aspect of m-healthcare system security, shedding light on the vulnerabilities and proposing feasible solutions. By adopting a proactive approach to counter DDoS attacks, the proposed architecture holds the potential to significantly enhance the reliability and privacy of m-health systems, ultimately benefiting patients and healthcare providers alike. The proposed approach taken is innovative and promising.},

On the other hand, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remains one of the major concerns for organizational network infrastructures and Cloud providers. In this article, the authors propose a Neural Network based Traffic Flow Classifier (TFC-NN) for live DDoS detection in SDN environments. This study provides a live traffic analysis method with a neural network. The training of the TFC-NN model is performed by a labelled dataset constructed from SDN normal traffic and an-under DDoS traffic. The study also provides a live mitigation process combined with the live TFC-NN-based DDoS detection. The approach is deployed and evaluated on an SDN architecture based on different performance metrics with different under-DDoS attack scenarios.},

	abstract = {Cloud firewalls stand as one of the major building blocks of the cloud security framework protecting the Virtual Private Infrastructure against attacks such as the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). In order to fully characterize the cloud firewall operation and gain actionable insights on the design of cloud security, performance models for the cloud firewall become imperative. In this article, we propose a multi-dimensional Continuous-Time Markov Chain model for the cloud firewall that takes into account the burstiness and correlation features of the legitimate and malicious data traffic. By adopting the Markov-Modulated Poisson process (MMPP) and the Interrupted Poisson Process (IPP), we identify the workload conditions under which the cloud firewall might be subject to a loss of availability. Furthermore, by comparing the IPP and Poisson attacks, we numerically verify that the cloud firewall is inherently vulnerable to a burstiness-aware attack which might seriously compromise its operation. Additionally, we characterize the joint harmful impact of burstiness and correlation on the cloud firewall that might lead to performance degradation. Finally, we design an elastic doud firewall by proposing a MMPP-driven load balancing procedure that provisions virtual firewalls dynamically while fulfilling a Service Level Agreement (SLA) latency specification.},

	abstract = {Security attacks are a nightmare to many computing environments such as fog computing, and these attacks should be addressed. Fog computing environments are vulnerable to various kinds of DDoS attacks, which can keep fog resources busy. Typically in such attacks, fog environments often have less available resources, which can negatively impact the scheduling of Internet of Things (IoT) submitted workflows. However, most of the existing scheduling schemes do not consider DDoS attacks effect in the scheduling process, increasing the deadline missed workflows and offloaded tasks on the cloud. For dealing with these issues, a hybrid optimization algorithm is proposed, comprising both Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Salp Swarm algorithm (SSA), to solve the workflow scheduling problem in multiple fog computing environments. Two discrete-time Markov chain models are proposed for each fog computing environment to address DDoS attacks effects on them. Our first Markov model computes the average available network bandwidth for each fog. The second Markov model finds the average number of available virtual machines (VMs) for each fog; the models address different levels of DDoS attacks. Extensive simulations show that by predicting the effects of DDoS attacks on fog environments, the proposed approach can effectively mitigate the number of offloaded tasks on cloud data centers and can reduce the number of the deadline missed workflows.},

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is now a well-established approach in 5G, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing. The primary idea behind its immense popularity is the separation of its underlying intelligence from the data-carrying components like routers and switches. The intelligence of the SDN-based networks lies in the central point, popularly known as the SDN controller. It is the central control hub of the SDN-based network, which has full privileges and a global view over the entire network. Providing security to SDN controllers is one such important task. Whenever one wishes to implement SDN into their data center or network, they are required to provide the website to SDN controllers. Several attacks are becoming a hurdle in the exponential growth of SDN, and among all one such attack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. In a couple of years, several new SDN controllers will be available. Among many, Open Networking Operating System (ONOS) and OpenDayLight (ODL) are two popular SDN controllers laying the foundation for many other controllers. These SDN controllers are now being used by numerous businesses, including Cisco, Juniper, IBM, Google, etc. In this paper, vulnerability analysis is carried out against DDoS attacks on the latest released versions of both ODL and ONOS SDN controllers in real-time cloud data centers. For this, we have considered distributed SDN controllers (located at different locations) on two different clouds (AWS and Azure). These controllers are connected through the Internet and work on different networks. DDoS attacks are bombarded on the distributed SDN controllers, and vulnerability is analyzed. It was observed with experimentation that, under five different scenarios (malicious traffic generated), ODL-3 node cluster controller had performed better than ONOS. In these five different scenarios, the amount of malicious traffic was incregradually increased. It also observed that, in terms of disk utilization, memory utilization, and CPU utilization, the ODL 3-node cluster was way ahead of the SDN controller.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack has been a serious threat to the availability feature of cloud computing. As traditional DDoS attacks are implemented using a huge volume of malicious traffic, the detection of such attacks becomes a naive task. To evade this detection, attackers are moving towards the Low-Rate DDoS (LRDDoS) attacks. The stealthy behavior of LRDDoS attack makes it difficult to get detected due to its low volume traffic. The existing frequency-domain approaches for LRDDoS detection are not feasible in terms of computational and storage requirements. This paper aims to propose a lightweight, accurate, and adaptive approach for the detection of LRDDoS attacks in frequency-domain. In this paper, the LRDDoS attack is detected by analyzing the power spectral distribution. The novelty of the proposed approach is to calculate the power spectral density using Fast Hartley Transform (FHT). The FHT processes real-valued input data, and has low computational and storage complexities. The approach is implemented on OpenStack cloud platform, and the aggregate network traffic (external and internal) is captured and analyzed. Experimental results show that the computational and storage complexities involved in FHT are lower than other transformation algorithms' complexities. Thus, the approach provides faster response with an average detection time of 60.16 s. The average true negative and true positive rates obtained by the proposed approach are 99.83\% and 99.46\% respectively, which are competitive.},

	abstract = {Today, mobile cloud computing is very popular, because of its characteristics, where the cloud computing offers services via the mobile networks. This makes it more attractive to attackers. Many complex attack targets cloud networks are used, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS). Thus, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) based on sensors and distributed IDSs are deployed to reinforce security and to protect data and services provided to customers. In this article, we propose a multi-layer and cooperative distributed intrusion detection system for mobile cloud computing (LC-IDS: layer-based cooperative IDS). The proposed LC-IDS is able to detect distributed and cooperative attacks based on risk analysis, after identifying and comparing the most used distributed intrusion detection systems, deployed in mobile cloud networks. Compared to existing works, the simulation results prove that our approach is efficient in terms of false positive and true positive rates, with minimal detection delay of 0.7 s for six OpenStack instances.},

	abstract = {The wide dispersion of the Internet of Things (IoT), Software-defined Networks and Cloud Computing have given the wings to Cyber-Physical System adoption. The newfangled society relies so much on Cyber-Physical Systems, such as Smart Cities, Smart Agriculture, Medical Cyber System, that a dearth to any of the available services may lead to severe concerns. The IoT devices are unwittingly contributing to the denial of service attacks. Though the neoteric Software-defined Anything (SDx) paradigm has offered effective solution approaches to catastrophic IoT-based DDoS attacks, the novel designed solutions confront various vulnerabilities due to less secure IoT devices, high-volume real-time network traffic generated by the colossal amount of IoT devices, etc. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on vulnerability analysis of security solutions for Software-defined Cyber-Physical System. The paper delineates the architectural details of the Software-defined Cyber-Physical System and recommends amalgamation of Fog Computing as one of the architectural layers for overcoming a number of vulnerabilities. As contemporary technologies like IoT, Software-defined Networking and Cloud Computing are the soup ingredients of the Software-defined Cyber-Physical System, each of the individual components has been auscultated individually for security vulnerabilities with a focus on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS and IoT-based DDoS) attacks. To anticipate the future recasting of the novel paradigm, we discuss the ongoing research and detailed vulnerability analysis with a focus on resiliency, performance, and scalability. Last but not least, we discuss the lessons learned and prospects to conclude. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The application layer HTTP flooding attack is the primary threat to web servers hosting web services in the cloud network. Due to varying network changes in the cloud, the traditional security methods are not sufficient to detect the attack. Therefore, a novel approach is proposed, which uses Teacher Learner Based Optimization (TLBO) for clustering to identify the attack requests. In this work, the logs of a web server under attack are collected and pre-processed. Further, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the pre-processed data. Thereafter the data is clustered using TLBO clustering, which will separate the application layer HTTP flooding attack in one cluster and rest of the requests in the other cluster. The results prove that the proposed approach performs better than other traditional and bio-inspired clustering techniques. The proposed approach also attains the peak detection rate and lowermost false alarm, which proves the efficacy of the proposed approach among another state of the art approaches.},

	abstract = {Detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks has become a significant security issue for various network technologies. This attack has to be detected to increase the system's reliability. Though various traditional studies are present, they suffer from data shift issues and accuracy. Hence, this study intends to detect DDoS attacks by classifying the normal and malicious traffic. The study aims to solve the data shift issues by using the introduced Decision Tree Detection (DTD) model encompassing of Greedy Feature Selection (GFS) algorithm and Decision Tree Algorithm (DTA). It also attempts to enhance the proposed model's detection rate (accuracy) above 90\%. Various processes are involved in DDoS attack detection. Initially, the gureKddcup dataset is loaded to perform pre-processing. This process is essential for removing noisy data. After this, feature selection is performed to select only the relevant features, removing the irrelevant data. This is then fed into the train and test split. Following this, Software Defined Networking (SDN) based DTA is used to classify the normal and malicious traffic, then given to the trained model for predicting this attack. Performance analysis is undertaken by comparing the proposed model with existing systems in terms of accuracy, MCC (Matthew's Correlation Coefficient), sensitivity, specificity, error rate, FAR (False Alarm Rate), and AUC (Area under Curve). This analysis is carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model, which is verified through the results.},

	abstract = {Current cloud computing expects to face huge traffic costs, data loads, and high latency due to the explosion of data from devices as the IoT and 5G technology evolve. Fog computing has emerged to overcome these issues. It deploys small fog servers at the edge of the network to process critical data in real time while sending the remaining secondary tasks to the central cloud, instead of sending massive amounts of data to the cloud. With the rise in fog computing, among traditional security threats, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have become the major threat to availability. This is especially true for fog computing, where real-time processing is critical; there are many fog servers, and the processing power is relatively low. Distributed reflection denial-of-service (DRDoS), one of the frequently used DDoS attack techniques, is an amplification attack that can be used on a small or large scale. It is widely used in attack tools due to its easy configuration. This study analyzes the characteristics of fog computing, the characteristics of DRDoS attacks, and the advantages and disadvantages of existing countermeasures. Based on these analyses, this study proposes a model that could effectively mitigate attacks even on low-specification fog servers by combining a modified Snort module with reduced functionality, simple pattern matching, and filtering distribution using Anycast. This mitigation algorithm has a simple structure rather than a complex filtering structure. To achieve this goal, this study virtually implemented the corresponding fog IoT environment. In spite of its simple structure, it proved that the fog server could secure availability even under DRDoS attacks by implementing and validating the mitigation model.},

	abstract = {As the use of devices in mobile environments increases, network attacks such as DDoS have a malicious attempt to flood the network's regular traffic to overload the target and surrounding infrastructure. This research proposed machine learning and deep learning approaches to dealing with DDoS attacks, and the results are described as follows. First, this research successfully detected DDoS attacks through an LGBM with a 100\% accuracy score. Second, the proposed model (GRU-LM), which consists of a trained Word2vec layer with the Python dataset, is far more effective than the standard GRU model. Since Python is quite similar to English, language model-based GRU yields superior results. Various preprocessing steps were performed through the NLTK package, and each number was assigned to the tokenized one for constructing the GRU language model. The result reveals that the proposed model achieved an accuracy score of 87\% for predicting the following words in the source code, while the rest achieved below 30\% accuracy. This conclusion is significant because its relatively simple and light structure overcomes tradeoff problems between time and accuracy and is adaptable to the mobile setting. Discovering traffic patterns for the underlying data of DDOS assaults and retrieving them using statistical data analysis is the value of this research. Furthermore, since public cloud application vulnerability assaults are rising due to expanding cloud infrastructure, this finding could be used in such attacks.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a severe type of attack. It affects the cloud in terms of loss of repudiation, service outage, financial loss, and data loss. Hence, the optimal feature selection and the hybrid learning-based classifier are developed for evading the normal function disruption in the cloud server. After pre-processing, the resultant data is subjected to the ensemble feature selection. The first feature is selected optimally by the Probability of Fitness-based Billiards-Inspired Optimization (PF-BIO) algorithm, the second feature selection is acquired through the Fisher discriminant, and the last feature selection is carried out by feature correlation with class. Consequently, the resultant of these feature selections is concatenated with the weight parameter to provide weighted fused features, where the weight is getting optimized by the PF-BIO algorithm. Finally, a newly developed hybrid-based learning model, where the Deep Belief Network with the Gated Recurrent Unit (DBN-GRU), in which the hyper parameters are tuned and optimized by the PF-BIO algorithm. Thus, the performance is compared with the existing approaches. Throughout the result analysis, the accuracy of the designed method is 97.05\%. Hence, the proposed model proves the efficiency for the detection of DDoS attacks precisely.},

By deploying efficient IDS in cloud networks which we term in this paper as the Cloud IDS, we can achieve cloud load balancing. For this, in this paper, we propose a machine learning based IDS for deployment in cloud networks. Our machine learning method has two stages. In the first stage, the traffic dimensionality is reduced by the proposed method. In the second stage, the network traffic classification is carried by the proposed network traffic similarity function. For experimental analysis, we have used CICIDS 2019 traffic data. The results proved that the proposed method has performed substantially better to state-of-art machine learning classifiers.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing enables the data owners to store and host their data on the cloud storage servers, which is to accessed by data consumers from the cloud storage servers whenever needed. The approach provides not only better accessibility but also unlimited storage capacity to the users. Even though there are numerous benefits of the approach, but security remains the prime concern for cloud computing and cloud service users. There are few solutions that provide protection in cloud computing, but even after having these solution, trust in cloud service providers remains the prime concern for cloud users. To overcome such a situation and to enhance the faith amongst the user and cloud service provider, a hybrid monitoring scheme (SecHMS) have been proposed and evaluated in this paper. The hybrid monitoring scheme (SecHMS) uses publickey cryptography and hashing technique to provide data security in cloud computing. The hybrid scheme (SecHMS) constantly monitors the stored data on behalf of end-users. As user's data is getting continuously monitored, it leads to the enhancement of trust for the end- user in cloud computing systems. A thorough analysis has been done on different size files, and results have been demonstrated to show the correctness of SecHMS scheme.},

	abstract = {n the cloud era, cloud Application Programming Interface (API) is the best carrier for servicedelivery, capability replication and data output. However, cloud API increases the exposure and attack surfaceof cloud application while opening up services and data. Through data hijacking, traffic analysis and othertechnologies, attackers can obtain the key resources of the target cloud API, so as to identify the identity andbehavior of users, or even directly cause the paralysis of the underlying system. Currently, there are many typesof attacks against cloud APIs, and their threats and protection methods are different. However, the existingresearches lack a systematic summary for cloud API attack and protection methods. In this paper, a detailsurvey on the threats and protection methods faced by cloud API is conducted. Firstly, the evolution and theclassification of cloud API are analyzed. The vulnerability of cloud API and the importance of cloud APIsecurity research are then discussed. Furthermore, a systematical cloud API security research framework isproposed, which covers six aspects: identity authentication, cloud API Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)attack protection, replay attack protection, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack protection, injection attackprotection and sensitive data protection. In addition, the necessity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) protection forcloud API is discussed. Finally, the future challenges and development trends of cloud API protection are presented},

	abstract = {The trend towards intelligent control processes has introduced the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing technologies to factories. IoT devices can sense data and send it to a cloud for further analysis in a factory. Consequently, the quantity of such valuable data flowing in an industrial cyber-physical system has gradually increased. Tailoring a risk assessment system for Industrial IoT (IIoT) is essential, particularly for a cloud platform that handles the IIoT data flow. In this study, we leverage analytic hierarchy processes (AHPs) and propose Hierarchical Risk Assessment Model (HiRAM) for an IIoT cloud platform. The proposed model allows the platform to self-evaluate its security status. Furthermore, a modular and responsive Risk Assessment System based on HiRAM, called HiRAM-RAS, is realized and evaluated in a real-world IIoT cloud platform. We deploy HiRAM-RAS to a sample application and introduce the practical deployment procedures. We then estimate the practicality of the HiRAM-RAS by injecting different degrees of errors and launching Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The results demonstrate the changes in integrity and availability scores evaluated by HiRAM.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing provides various cost-effective on-demand services to the user and so it is rising like a real trend in the IT service model. However, due to its open and distributed architecture, it is highly vulnerable to attackers. The security and privacy of cloud users has become a major hurdle. The most prevalent approach for detecting attacks on the cloud is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Scalability and autonomous self-adaptation weren't features of contemporary IDS deployed in traditional Internet or Intranet contexts. Furthermore, they lack determinism, making them inappropriate for cloud-based settings. This necessitates the development of new cloud-based IDS capable of fulfilling the firm's security standards. Therefore, in this research work, we have introduced a new IDS model for the cloud environment. Our research work is made up of four major phases: ``data pre-processing, optimal clustering, feature selection, and attack detection phase{''}. Initially, the collected raw data are pre-processed to enhance the quality of the data. Then, these pre-processed data are segmented with the newly introduced K-means clustering model, where we've optimally selected the centroids by introducing a new hybrid optimization model referred as Spider Monkey Updated with Sealion Optimization (SMSLO), which is the conceptual hybridization of standard SeaLion Optimization (SLnO) and Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO), respectively. At the end of segmentation, two clusters (attack data and non-attack data) will be formed. The data available in both clusters seems to be huge in dimensions, so we've lessened the dimensions of the data in the clusters by applying the ``Principal Component Analysis (PCA){''} algorithm. Subsequently, these dimensionality-reduced features pass into the attack detection phase. The attack detection phase is modeled with the optimized Deep Belief Network (DBN), which portrays the type of attack (Dos, Botnet, DDoS as well) that intruded into the network. Since the DBN makes the final detections; it is ought to be less prone to errors. We have lessened the detection errors such as the Mean Square Error (MSE) of DBN by fine-tuning its weight using a new hybrid optimization model (SMSLO). Finally, the result acquired from the proposed work (DBN+SMSLO) is validated.},

	abstract = {In the recent era, the cloud plays a critical role as a large amount of information is used to provide certain services for certain applications. As cloud services are a challenging task, security is a major limitation as it provides certain services in the cloud sector. The information used in the cloud framework has shared data as it ensures data is more reliable and secure while providing the services; in the above case, it needs a certain encryption approach as it makes improved performance in terms of data. In order to enhance the security, the trusted key-based secure communication (TK-SCom) model is proposed as it combines cryptography along with a data classification with fuzzy-based learning approach and it performs the encryption and decryption process for a larger volume of data. The data classification is performed between the sender and receiver as the classification contains classifier for optimizing the energy efficiency, i.e. modified boost classifier to check whether the data is normal or abnormal based on DDoS attack. Based on the data classification, the data authentication is performed to ensure security in the proposed TK-SCom model. In the performance analysis, the data classification is analyzed based on detection rate and classification accuracy. Then the proposed TK-SCom model security is ensured based on operational cost and computational time.},

	abstract = {Anomalies could be the threats to the network that have ever/never happened. To protect networks against malicious access is always challenging even though it has been studied for a long time. Due to the evolution of network in both new technologies and fast growth of connected devices, network attacks are getting versatile as well. Comparing to the traditional detection approaches, machine learning is a novel and flexible method to detect intrusions in the network, it is applicable to any network structure. In this paper, we introduce the challenges of anomaly detection in the traditional network, as well as in the next generation network, and review the implementation of machine learning in the anomaly detection under different network contexts. The procedure of each machine learning category is explained, as well as the methodologies and advantages are presented. The comparison of using different machine learning models is also summarised.},

	abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to provide a theoretically and empirically grounded discussion on big data and to propose a conceptual framework for big data based on a temporal dimension. This study adopts two research methods. The first research method is a critical assessment of the literature that aims to identify the concept of big data in a cloud gateway. This method is composed of a search for source materials, the selection of the source materials, and their analysis and synthesis. It has been used to develop a conceptual framework for assessing a cloud gateway's readiness to adopt big data. The purpose of the second research method is to provide an initial verification of the developed framework. We built the suggested network using Ethereum blockchain technology and tested it against industry standards for security, Such as precision and security response time. The results show that the proposed security solutions achieve better results than the current solutions, and this architecture provides the following solutions to reduce the authentication, integrity, and confidentiality issues of the heterogeneous IoT and the central gates that make up the cloud gate. The results of our analysis show that, within appropriate E-business paradigms, BC technology can play an efficient role in facilitating active tasks for all activities over the architecture of IoT in many domains. We also experiment with our design and make a comprehensive discussion. (C) 2021 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.},

	abstract = {The network security and cloud environment have been playing vital roles in today's era due to increased network data transmission, the cloud's elasticity, pay as you go and global distributed resources. A recent survey for the cloud environment involving 300 organizations in North America with 500 or more employees who had spent a minimum of USD 1 million on cloud infrastructure, as per March 2022 statistics, stated that 79\% of organizations experienced at least one cloud data breach. In the year 2022, the AWS cloud provider leads the market share with 34\% and a USD 200 billion cloud market, proving important and producing the motivation to improve the detection of intrusion with respect to network security on the basis of the AWS cloud dataset. The chosen CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 dataset had network attack details based on the real time attack carried out on the AWS cloud infrastructure. The proposed method here is the hybrid deep learning based approach, which uses the raw data first to do the pre-processing and then for normalization. The normalized data have been feature extracted from seventy-six fields to seven bottlenecks using Principal Component Analysis (PCA); those seven extracted features of every packet have been categorized as two-way soft-clustered (attack and non-attack) using the Smart Monkey Optimized Fuzzy C-Means algorithm (SMO-FCM). The attack cluster data have been further provided as inputs for the deep learning based AutoEncoder algorithm, which provides the outputs as attack classifications. Finally, the accuracy of the results in intrusion detection using the proposed technique (PCA + SMO-FCM + AE) is achieved as 95\% over the CSE-CIC-IDS-2018 dataset, which is the highest known for state-of-the-art protocols compared with 11 existing techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an in-depth study and analysis of hierarchical network security measurement and optimal active defense in the cloud computing environment. All the cloud platform security-related data collected through cloud platform monitoring is collected, and then the relevant security data is summarized and analyzed, so that the specific security posture index of the cloud platform can be derived, thus providing a reference for cloud platform managers to judge the security risks of the cloud platform. It provides a reference for cloud platform managers to judge the security risks of cloud platforms. Through the cloud platform security situation awareness system, we mainly study the construction of cloud platform, the construction of security situation awareness system, and the calculation of security situation value and use, thus greatly improving the stability, security, and reliability of the cloud platform. The application of the method avoids the drawbacks of traditional network security management, which relies entirely on past data and cannot sense changes in the security state of the system in real time. At the same time, the predicted results are added to the input of the fuzzy decision-making system, improving the accuracy of the assessment. The method improves the real-time and effectiveness of network security posture prediction, increases the convergence speed and prediction accuracy of the algorithm, and avoids the occurrence of overfitting. Simulation experiments based on the internet network security posture dataset show that this research method has less prediction error than the traditional machine learning methods and other deep learning methods, has higher learning efficiency, and is more rapid, accurate, and effective in predicting the trend of network security posture in the big data environment in the future period.},

	abstract = {Smart agriculture is a popular domain due to its intensified growth in recent times. This domain aggregates the advantages of several computing technologies, where the IoT is the most popular and beneficial. In this work, a novel and effective deep learning-based framework is developed to detect intrusions in smart farming systems. The architecture is three-tier, with the first tier being the sensor layer, which involves the placement of sensors in agricultural areas. The second tier is the Fog Computing Layer (FCL), which consists of Fog nodes, and the proposed IDS is implemented in each Fog node. The gathered information is transferred to this fog layer for further data analysis. The third tier is the cloud computing layer, which provides data storage and end-to-end services. The proposed model includes a fused CNN model with the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) model to detect and classify intruders. An attention mechanism is included within the BiGRU model to find the key features responsible for identifying the DDoS attack. In addition, the accuracy of the classification model is improved by using a nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called the Wild Horse Optimization (WHO) algorithm. The last layer is the cloud layer, which collects data from fog nodes and offers storage services. The proposed system will be implemented in the Python platform, using ToN-IoT and APA-DDoS attack datasets for assessment. The proposed system outperforms the existing methods in accuracy (99.35\%), detection rate (98.99\%), precision (99.9\%) and F-Score (99.08\%) for the APA DDoS attack dataset and the achieved accuracy of the ToN-IoT dataset (99.71\%), detection rate (99.02\%), precision (99.89\%) and F-score (99.05\%).},

	abstract = {Currently, core networking architectures are facing disruptive developments, due to emergence of paradigms such as Software-Defined-Networking (SDN) for control, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for services, and so on. These are the key enabling technologies for future applications in 5G and locality-based Internet of things (IoT)/wireless sensor network services. The proliferation of IoT devices at the Edge networks is driving the growth of all-connected world of Internet traffic. In the Cloud-to-Things continuum, processing of information and data at the Edge mandates development of security best practices to arise within a fog computing environment. Service providers are transforming their business using NFV-based services and SDN-enabled networks. The SDN paradigm offers an easily programmable model, global view, and control for modern networks, which demand faster response to security incidents and dynamically enforce countermeasures to intrusions and cyberattacks. This article proposes an autonomic multilayer security framework called Distributed Threat Analytics and Response System (DTARS) for a converged architecture of Fog/Edge computing and SDN infrastructures, for emerging applications in IoT and 5G networks. The major detection scheme is deployed within the data plane, consisting of a coarse-grained behavioral, anti-spoofing, flow monitoring and fine-grained traffic multi-feature entropy-based algorithms. We developed exemplary defense applications under DTARS framework, on a malware testbed imitating the real-life DDoS/botnets such as Mirai. The experiments and analysis show that DTARS is capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 95\% under attack intensities up to 50 000 packets/s. The benign traffic forwarding rate remains unaffected with DTARS, while it drops down to 65\% with traditional NIDS for advanced DDoS attacks. Further, DTARS achieves this performance without incurring additional latency due to data plane overhead.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, a large number of web services have been emerging quickly, which brings a heavy burden for users to choose the services they preferred. In order to suggest web services for users, recommendation algorithms are needed and many of them have been investigated recently. However, most of the existing recommendation schemes are based on centralized historical data, which may lead to single point of failure. Generally, the data contains a lot of sensitive information that cloud may expose the privacy of users, which makes most cloud platforms reluctant to share their own data. In order to solve the above issues, the secure data sharing among cloud platforms is necessary for better recommendation, which can maximize the profits. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted collaborative service recommendation scheme (BC -SRDS). Specifically, we adopt the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) algorithm to encrypt the data, which ensures the data confidentiality and realizes secure data sharing. Then, we utilize the blockchain to share data, such that the DoS attack, DDoS attack and single point of failure can be avoided. Meanwhile, the data integrity, tampering-proof of data are guaranteed through the blockchain. And we use locality-sensitive hashing algorithm to recommend the services for users. Finally, it is proved through the security analysis that BC -SRDS is capable of achieving data confidentiality, data integrity and tampering-proof. A series of experiments show that BC -SRDS achieves better recommendation accuracy compared with the existing schemes.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has become ubiquitous in our daily lives in recent years. Data are the source of technology that is generated hugely by various sources. Big data is dealing with huge data volumes or complex data. The major concern in big data is security threats. Security concerns create a negative impact on the user on the aspect of trust. In big data still, security threats exist as commonly known as DDOS (Distributed-Denial-of-Service) attacks, data loss, Inadequate Data Backups, System Vulnerabilities, and Phishing as well as Social Engineering Attacks. In our work, we have taken the data loss and Inadequate Data Backups issues into consideration. We analyze that RSA (Rivest, Shamir, \& Adleman) is the most secure cryptography mechanism. In cloud computing, user authentication is the weaker section to be secured. Generally, the cryptography mechanism is done in the authentication section only. We implemented our new idea of registration with selected images and pins for processing RSA. By valid authentication approval earned by the proposed mechanism, the user is allowed to use the cloud database, encryption, decryption, etc. To prove the efficiency level of our proposed system, a comparison work is conducted between DSSE (Digital Signature Standard Encryption) and EFSSA (Efficient framework for securely sharing a file using asymmetric key distribution management). The experimental work is carried out and the performance evaluation is done using encryption time and decryption time analysis, throughput, and processing time. On this observation, the security level attained by ERSA is far better in comparison to DSSE and EFSSA with the maximum throughput attained by the proposed E-RSA being 500 Mb/Min and encryption time of 3.2 s, thus ensuring the user trust in using the cloud environment.},

	abstract = {The integration of the Internet of things and dynamic vehicles has become unavoidable in advanced transportation systems. The vehicles communicate wirelessly with other vehicles, cloud servers, and roadside units via open communication channels. The openness of the above-mentioned entities and their communication tools introduces new difficulties, such as data privacy, vulnerabilities, data integrity, and scalability. To enhance data privacy and ensure security, a lightweight authenticated privacy-preserving secure framework is presented in the Internet of vehicles deployment. The proposed scheme can achieve confidentiality, privacy, authenticity, integrity, anonymity, and perfect forward secrecy based on blockchain technology, elliptic curve cryptography, and a one-way hash function. The proposed framework is secure against well-known cyberattacks, including replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, traffic analysis attacks, and DDoS attacks. The security analysis shows the robustness of the proposed scheme. Finally, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient and feasible in practice.},

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is an agile, modern networking approach that facilitates innovations in the networking paradigm. The abstracted and centralized network operating system facilitates the network management and reduces operational expenditure (OPEX). The open nature and simplicity of the data-forwarding plane dramatically reduces capital expenditure (CAPEX) by leveraging commodity servers and switches. SDN also lends itself very well to address major cloud computing issues and complement cloud services, especially in terms of network virtualization and networking as a service (NaaS). As a new technology, SDN does involve certain security challenges, which include distributed denial of service (DDoS) threats, build and run time injected malware, insider (tenant) attacks, and security holes resulting from controller misconfigurations. These are severe threats that can cripple an entire network. It is crucial to address the SDN vulnerabilities to ensure its successful deployment in private data center networks, on cloud platforms and beyond. Some security solutions leverage the built-in features of SDN, such as its controller software component, while other solutions provide external SDN applications running above the controller. This study reviews the security solutions for the vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art SDN controllers and the available countermeasures. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the SDN features that support security is presented, and some unresolved research issues on SDN controllers are identified.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of network technology, there are more and more application scenarios of software defined networking (SDN), such as big data, cloud computing, internet of things, etc. However, the facilities in the SDN network face security issues such as DDoS attacks, network monitoring, and privacy. In addition, the SDN controller is also the main target of the attacker. This paper makes a simple analysis of the security risks in SDN and proposes a machine learning-based intrusion detection system for SDN (ML-SDNIDS). According to the characteristics of SDN, ML-SDNIDS uses autoencoder and one-class support vector machine algorithm to train intrusion detection model in the control plane, and uses P4 programming language combined with machine learning algorithm to realise real-time intrusion detection function in the data plane. And compared with the traditional SVM and OCSVM intrusion detection models in the latest intrusion detection dataset CIC-DDoS2019, the experimental results show that the scheme proposed in this paper has greatly improved the detection accuracy and the execution efficiency of the model. In addition, this experimental scheme can make the intrusion detection accuracy of data plane P4 switch as high as 97\%, and its packet transmission efficiency is still millisecond.},

	abstract = {The advancements and rapid adoption of service oriented architecture, utility computing, virtualization, etc., have emerged in a new computing paradigm called cloud computing, in the last few years. Cloud computing enables on-demand delivery of data, software, and hardware in the form of services over the Internet. But the growing scale of cloud-users and type-of-services urge for an autonomous environment to automate the highly complex cloud environment in a suitable way to improve the overall management of the cloud systems. To counter these automation related issues, autonomic computing (AC) emerges as a potential solution to optimize the performance of cloud computing. The merge of these two prominent technologies gives rise to a new technological domain called autonomic cloud computing (ACC). In this survey article, the existing AC assisted solutions for cloud computing is broadly categorized into two groups, namely features based and parameters based. Features based solutions are further classified into management (of services, workload, and resources) and security aware solutions. Similarly, parameters based solutions are grouped into quality-of-service aware and performance management solutions. Finally, the comparative analysis of state-of-the-art ACC approaches with respect to the approach referred, performance metrics, outcome, and the derived inference is also presented to have an in-depth understanding of the existing literature. Overall, the work excites the research community to design the effective autonomous solutions for ACC resources and services. Additionally, several research gaps and challenges are identified and discussed in this article based on the study with a focus on the future research directions.},

	abstract = {The term ``Internet of Things{''} (IoT) encompasses an entire group of gadgets that are capable of connecting to the Internet in order to gather and share data. The IoT paradigm is being pushed into computer networks by numerous highly advanced intrusions. Cloud computing greatly enhances the success of the IoT by enabling users to perform computing tasks using Internet-based services accessed through connected devices. This seamless integration of cloud technology and the IoT has become a powerful catalyst, revolutionizing the way we operate. The adoption of a distributed architecture, such as cloud computing, exposes the system to potential threats like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. To mitigate these risks, the concept of an intrusion detection system (IDS) has been introduced within the cloud environment. Various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed and implemented to effectively detect and respond to such malicious traffic in the cloud system. For dimension reduction during the training process of those algorithms, multiple independent and hybrid techniques have been proposed. This study presents an efficient ML-based real-time IDS framework with proposed hybrid feature selection techniques. Additionally, in this study, a concise comparative analysis has been conducted using five well-known public datasets. The findings presented in this paper reveal that our proposed IDS achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.98\% in identifying malicious traffic.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a paradigm that acts as an emerging technology with the intent of multimedia. Nevertheless, multimedia computing faces a financial burden. The essential characteristic of cloud computing is the cloud's pay-as-you-go pricing model. Hence, several attacks are affecting cloud services since the threats are present long term. Such harmful attacks are named Fraudulent Resource Consumption (FRC) attacks. Due to this nature, attack detection is a critical task in cloud computing. To alleviate the problem, the proposed work is intended to detect and mitigate the FRC attack in the cloud without any vital issues. Initially, the HTTP web-server logs are collected from the benchmark source, and the data preprocessing is performed for sequence generation, followed by the sequence decomposition process. Here, the Heuristic-based Discrete Wavelet Transform is developed by the Adaptive Deer Hunting Optimization Algorithm (ADHOA) that is to be adopted for decomposing the sequence. Further, the hyper-parameter Tuned-Recurrent Neural Network (HT-RNN) with estimating attack percentage is conducted for FRC detection. Once the detection of the FRC attack is done, then the mitigation procedure is processed for blocking them. Throughout the experimental analysis, the accuracy of the proposed ADHOA-HT-RNN method has attained 96\%, and also, the precision of the proposed work offers 94\%. The specificity of the designed model has secured 92\%. The performance is assessed, and its result proves that the recommended system exploits the better detection performance. Thus, the simulation outcome has shown that the proposed ADHOA-HT-RNN model has attained superior performance compared to the other conventional approaches.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks poses a significant challenge to the Internet and cloud environments, including emerging architectures like Named Data Networking (NDN). Among the threats faced by NDN, interest flooding attacks (IFAs) have emerged as a prominent issue. This study presents a novel method for detecting IFAs in NDN by analyzing data name prefix distribution in network traffic to determine the appropriate detection window size. IFAs involve adding a random suffix to a prefix in network traffic, leading to a barrage of interest packets that overwhelm the target without receiving responses. Building upon this observation, a new type of DoS attack called Collaborative Interest Flooding Attack (CIFA) has been identified, which evades existing detection and protection systems using a low-rate attack mode facilitated by collusive manufacturers. To address these challenges, a detection approach combining a rolling time window algorithm and attack detection methodology is proposed. This method evaluates the impact of CIFA attacks on network traffic and examines relevant properties of Pending Interest Table (PIT) entries. Furthermore, the analysis extends to the examination of prefixes in interest packets, providing comprehensive detection of interest flooding attacks. Additionally, the proposed approach effectively restricts the attacker's port by leveraging the PIT routing character entry to discourage IFA attacks. Experimental results obtained from real-world and simulated scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms in detecting DoS attacks. Comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methodologies reveals that the proposed approach outperforms them in terms of accuracy, precision, F-Score, GMean, specificity, and sensitivity. By enhancing the detection and mitigation capabilities against interest flooding attacks, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts in securing NDN and future Internet architectures, enabling a more robust and resilient network infrastructure.},

	abstract = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a crucial research field spawned by the Internet of Things (IoT). IIoT links all types of industrial equipment through the network; establishes data acquisition, exchange, and analysis systems; and optimizes processes and services, so as to reduce cost and enhance productivity. The introduction of edge computing in IIoT can significantly reduce the decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and to some extent, protect privacy. This paper outlines the research progress concerning edge computing in IIoT. First, the concepts of IIoT and edge computing are discussed, and subsequently, the research progress of edge computing is discussed and summarized in detail. Next, the future architecture from the perspective of edge computing in IIoT is proposed, and its technical progress in routing, task scheduling, data storage and analytics, security, and standardization is analyzed. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of edge computing in IIoT in terms of 5G-based edge communication, load balancing and data offloading, edge intelligence, as well as data sharing security. Finally, we introduce some typical application scenarios of edge computing in IIoT, such as prognostics and health management (PHM), smart grids, manufacturing coordination, intelligent connected vehicles (ICV), and smart logistics.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase in data traffic is forcing mobile network operators to enhance and expand their network infrastructure to meet the new requirements of customers' Service Level Agreements (SLA). Network Function Virtualization (NFV) provides abstractions of core network functions from the vendor-specific hardware. This allows the network functions to move around the cloud, providing better performance and scaling capabilities. However, deploying virtualized mobile core network in the cloud environment opens many security concerns not only regarding communication between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the mobile core network but also within the core network itself. In this paper, we propose a framework called virtual Evolved Packet Core - virtual Software Defined Perimeter (vEPC-vSDP) to provide secure communications within the mobile core network by using an authentication-based approach. The SDP components are virtualized and placed within the virtualized core network to provide a zero-trust environment where only authenticated and authorized core network elements can have access to one another. The analysis of the proposed vEPC-vSDP framework confirms its ability to shield the core network traffic from both external and internal attacks. The vEPC-vSDP framework was implemented and tested against Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and port scanning attacks to demonstrate the resilience of the proposed framework. The results show the capability of vEPC-vSDP to provide secure communication path to mobile core network elements.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is currently the most cost-effective means of providing commercial and consumer IT services online. However, it is prone to new flaws. An economic denial of sustainability attack (EDoS) specifically leverages the pay-per-use paradigm in building up resource demands over time, culminating in unanticipated usage charges to the cloud customer. We present an effective approach to mitigating EDoS attacks in cloud computing. To mitigate such distributed attacks, methods for detecting them on different cloud computing smart grids have been suggested. These include hard-threshold, machine, and deep learning, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF) tree algorithms, namely convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). These algorithms have greater accuracies and lower false alarm rates and are essential for improving the cloud computing service provider security system. The dataset of nine injection attacks for testing machine and deep learning algorithms was obtained from the Cyber Range Lab at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Canberra. The experiments were conducted in two categories: binary classification, which included normal and attack datasets, and multi-classification, which included nine classes of attack data. The results of the proposed algorithms showed that the RF approach achieved accuracy of 98\% with binary classification, whereas the SVM model achieved accuracy of 97.54\% with multi-classification. Moreover, statistical analyses, such as mean square error (MSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (R), and the root mean square error (RMSE), were applied in evaluating the prediction errors between the input data and the prediction values from different machine and deep learning algorithms. The RF tree algorithm achieved a very low prediction level (MSE = 0.01465) and a correlation R-2 (R squared) level of 92.02\% with the binary classification dataset, whereas the algorithm attained an R-2 level of 89.35\% with a multi-classification dataset. The findings of the proposed system were compared with different existing EDoS attack detection systems. The proposed attack mitigation algorithms, which were developed based on artificial intelligence, outperformed the few existing systems. The goal of this research is to enable the detection and effective mitigation of EDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {Securing Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is one of the most critical applications of cryptography over the Internet due to the value and importance of data contained in such EMRs. Although blockchain-based healthcare systems can provide security, privacy, and immutability to EMRs, several outstanding security and latency issues are associated with existing schemes. For example, some researchers have used the blockchain as a storage tool which increases delay and adversely affects the blockchain performance since it stores a copy of each transaction. A distributed ledger also requires appropriate space and computational power with increased data size. In addition, existing healthcare-based approaches usually rely on centralized servers connected to clouds, which are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS), distributed DoS (DDoS), and collusion attacks. This paper proposes a novel hybrid-deep learning-based homomorphic encryption (HE) model for the Industrial Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) to cope with such challenges using a consortium blockchain. Integrating HE with the proposed IIoMT system is a vital contribution of this work. The use of HE while outsourcing to the cloud the storage provides a unique facility to perform any statistical and machine learning operation on the encrypted EMR data, hence providing resistance to collusion and phishing attacks. Our proposed model uses a pre-trained hybrid deep learning model in the cloud and deploys the trained model into blockchain-based edge devices in order to classify and train local models using EMRs. This is further conditioned on the private data of each edge and IoT device connected with the consortium blockchain. All local models obtained are aggregated to the cloud to update a global model, which is finally disseminated to the edge nodes. Our proposed approach provides more privacy and security than conventional models and can deliver high efficiency and low end-to-end latency for users. Comparative simulation analysis with state-of-the-art approaches is carried out using benchmark performance metrics, which show that our proposed model provides enhanced security, efficiency, and transparency.},

	abstract = {Recent technologies and innovations have encouraged users to adopt cloud-based environment. Network intrusion detection (NID) is an important method for network system administrators to detect various security holes. The performance of traditional NID methods can be affected when unknown or new attacks are detected. For instance, existing intrusion detection systems may have overfitting, low classification accuracy, and high false positive rate (FPR) when faced with significantly large volume and variety of network data. For that reason, this system has been agreed by many establishments to allure the users with its suitable features. Because of its design, it is exposed to malicious attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is required to handle these issues which can detect such attacks accurately in a cloud environment. To analyze the IDS datasets some of the predominant choices are Deep learning and Machine learning (ML) algorithms. By adopting nature-inspired algorithms, the problems concerning the data quality and the usage of high-dimensional data can be managed. In this study the datasets KDD Cup 99 and NSL-KDD are used. The dataset is cleaned using the min-max normalization technique and it is processed using the 1-N encoding approach for achieving homogeneity. Dimensionality reduction is done using the Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm and further processing is done using the deep neural network (DNN). To minimize the energy consumption we have adopted the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) mechanism to the system. The main reason to set up this concept is to develop a balance between the energy consumption and the time of different modes of VMs or hosts. The proposed model is validated and compared with ACO and Principal component analysis (PCA)-based (Naive Bayes) NB models, the experimental outcomes proved the superiority of the ACO-DNN model over the existing methods.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the use of Software Defined Networking (SDN) has increased due to various network management requirements. Using SDN in computer network applications has brought several benefits to users, including lower operational costs, better hardware management, flexibility, and centralized network deployment. On the other hand, the Internet of Things (IoT) is another rapidly growing technology. Distributed and dynamic infrastructures are two critical characteristics of IoT. These characteristics lead to some challenges while using SDN in IoT in terms of security and privacy. In this paper, we address security and privacy issues and solutions for SDN-based IoT systems. We analyze the techniques used for defense in previous works to achieve an acceptable level of security and privacy protection in SDN-based IoT systems. In the data plane, SDN-based IoT papers have considered hashing and encryption techniques, in the control plane, certificate authority and access control have been analyzed, and in the application plane, attack detection, and authentication have been discussed. We also provide a statistical analysis of the existing work. This analysis shows that researchers have focused on certain areas more than others in recent years. The final analysis also highlights issues that previous researchers have ignored.},

	abstract = {Rowhammer is a memory-based attack that leverages capacitive-coupling to induce faults in modern dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Over the last decade, a significant number of Rowhammer attacks have been presented to reveal that it is a severe security issue capable of causing privilege escalations, launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and even runtime attack such as control flow hijacking. Moreover, the Rowhammer vulnerability has also been identified and validated in both cloud computing and data center environments, threatening data security and privacy at a large scale. Various solutions have been proposed to counter Rowhammer attacks but existing methods lack a circuit-level explanation of the capacitive-coupling phenomenon in modern DRAMs, the key cause of Rowhammer attacks. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of capacitive-coupling vulnerabilities in DRAMs. We thoroughly analyze all parameters in the mathematical model contributing to the Rowhammer vulnerability and quantify them through real DRAM measurements. We validate the model with different attributions on a wide range of DRAM brands from various manufacturers. Through our model we re-evaluate existing Rowhammer attacks on both DDR3 and DDR4 memory, including the recently developed TRRespass attack. Our analysis presents a new Rowhammer attack insight and will guide future research in this area.},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid advancement of technologies including the tremendous growth of multimedia content, cloud computing and mobile usage, conventional networks are not able to meet the demands. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) are considered one of the key enabling technologies providing a new powerful network architecture that allows the dynamic operation of different services using a common infrastructure. Despite their notable gains, SDNs may not be secure and are vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, we address the SDN vulnerabilities and present attack-specific feature selection to identify the features that have the most impact on anomaly detection. We first use the InSDN intrusion dataset that considers different attacks including Denial-of-Service (DoS), Distributed-DoS (DDoS), brute force, probe, web and botnet attacks. We then perform data pre-processing and apply univariate feature selection to select the features having the highest impact on the different attacks. These selected features can then be used to train the model which reduces the computational cost of modeling while keeping the high performance of the model. Detailed analysis and simulation results are then presented to show the predominant features and their impact on the different attacks.},

	abstract = {The healthcare industry went through reformation by integrating the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to enable data harnessing by transmission mediums from different devices, about patients to healthcare staff devices, for further analysis through cloud-based servers for proper diagnosis of patients, yielding efficient and accurate results. However, IoMT technology is accompanied by a set of drawbacks in terms of security risks and vulnerabilities, such as violating and exposing patients' sensitive and confidential data. Further, the network traffic data is prone to interception attacks caused by a wireless type of communication and alteration of data, which could cause unwanted outcomes. The advocated scheme provides insight into a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoMT networks. It leverages a honeypot to divert attackers away from critical systems, reducing the attack surface. Additionally, the IDS employs an ensemble method combining Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms. This approach harnesses the strengths of both algorithms to improve attack detection accuracy and robustness. This work analyzes the impact, performance, accuracy, and precision outcomes of the used model on two IoMT-related datasets which contain multiple attack types such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), Data Injection, and Distributed Denial of Services (DDOS). The yielded results showed that the proposed ensemble method was effective in detecting intrusion attempts and classifying them as attacks or normal network traffic, with a high accuracy of 92.5\% for the first dataset and 99.54\% for the second dataset and a precision of 96.74\% for the first dataset and 99.228\% for the second dataset.},

	abstract = {The large number of devices connected to the Internet have caused the traditional cloud computing model to become a bottleneck. In recent years, this has motivated the advancement of edge computing or fog computing, which provides analysis and processing capabilities closer to where the data is generated. Due to the large amount of information that will be exposed in Edge Computing, the need arises to study security in depth in the scenarios proposed by these new paradigms; For this reason, the present work shows the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), in which, of the 50 studies analyzed, 24 security problems were identified, which are identified as attacks that mostly affect the user. IoT and are also the most frequent in Edge Computing, some of these are: DoS and DDoS attack, manin-the-middle attack, phishing attack, replay attacks, collusion attack, physical manipulation attack, fake node injection and device cloning; In the same way, it was determined what: knowledge of the location, geographical distribution, decentralized architecture, mobility support, scalability and reduced energy consumption, are characteristics that contribute to the occurrence of security attacks.},

	abstract = {The increasing use of Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets in a daily rate has heightened security apprehension, particularly within the healthcare sector. In order to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, it is imperative for Internet of Things (IoT) systems to promptly and effectively respond to harmful activities. Nevertheless, the act of transferring data to distant cloud servers for the purpose of analysis gives rise to both temporal delays and apprehensions regarding privacy. To ensure the security of medical Internet of Things (MIoT) networks, a power -efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is employed for three primary objectives that it will result in three stages of execution: (i) The objective is to categorize different types of attacks, such as Man -in -the -Middle (MitM) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), by utilizing wellestablished machine learning (ML) techniques. This classification stage will serve to enhance the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and the reporting system. (ii) Anomaly detection (unknown attack identification), or detection of unknown attacks, will be employed to identify previously unknown attacks. This identification stage involves retraining the ML model to enable future recognition and classification of these unknown attacks when the anomaly attack detector identifies that an unknown attack is recognized. Then, a retraining of the first stage classification model is executed due to the anomaly detection. (iii) To ensure that a remote cloud server remains current with the latest classification model changes, Federated Learning (FL) will be utilized. FL allows for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy and security. The experimental findings indicate that the Enhanced Random Forest (also called ensemble random forest) algorithm achieves a remarkable accuracy rate of 99.98\% in classifying attacks. Thus, it will be our first stage classifier. Continuing, the OneClass Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm demonstrates a high level of accuracy, reaching 99.7\% in detecting anomalies so that it will be our second stage identifier. Finally, the third -stage approach, which has as a target the overall system model updater, will be our introduced Federated Learning approach that works with the Enhanced Random Forests and identifies the ERF differences from the old model in an optimal way. The efficacy of our technique is confirmed through the implementation of experiments involving an Internet of Things (IoT) system and a Raspberry Pi MIoT gateway and with simulations that simulate the FL updating process. These experiments successfully identify known and unknown attacks with a high reliability level while limiting resource utilization and energy consumption. Future studies of this work will focus on enhancing the scalability and efficiency of our Intrusion Detection System in MIoT networks.},

	abstract = {Security issues are the most critical challenges facing new technologies associated with the internet of things (IoT), big data, and cloud computing. A secure and efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) is crucial to detect security threats. Existing IDSs are known to suffer from many problems, most notably the high rate of false positive alerts, the long time required to detect attacks, and the inability to detect zero day attacks, which can ruin companies. The weakness of IDS backend engines costs companies time in the investigation process. This paper proposes and enhances IDS detection mechanisms via two processes: using a deep neural network (DNN) model with new features for threat detection based on two assumptions related to handling zero-day attacks, with low computing power and resources, and a comprehensive solution for detection by merging the DNN model and principle component analysis (PCA) to increase security and performance. The proposed detection mechanism combines DNN, PCA, statistical, and knowledge-based approaches to offer significantly greater efficiency than existing IDS, as indicated by analytical and software results. A simulation model is used with up-to-date web attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS), denial of service (DoS), brute force, insider infiltration, Botnet, and Heartbleed attacks. The proposed detection techniques for large networks are analyzed and complexity in the design is avoided by reducing the number of DNN model layers, thus minimizing detection time delay and false positives, while increasing security against network attacks. Integrating the proposed DNN with PCA, an innovative contribution, introduces robust IDS to significantly improve the detection time delay and security performance. The proposed model showed a 98\% accuracy rate. To best of our knowledge, the highest accuracy rate stated based on a large number of attacks is 97\%, which makes our model state of art.

	abstract = {By the development and advancement of blockchain technique, Internet of Things (IoT) proliferation driven devices and the application of blockchain-enabled IoT alter the view and operating infrastructure of the smart networks. The blockchain is responsible for supporting decentralized systems and offers secured means of authentication, management, and access to IoT system thereby deploying smart contracts offered by Ethereum. The increasing demand and the blockchain expansion generate huge volume of sensitive data. The growing demand and expansion of blockchain-IoT systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. Furthermore, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are regarded as the most promising threats for smart contracts in the blockchain-based systems. Therefore, there is a need to detect and classify the attack type and the data should be stored in server more securely with the use of blockchain and data aggregation method. For this purpose, this presented technique aims at introducing decentralized consensus blockchain and Interplanetary file system (IPFS) based data aggregation for effective classification and data storage. The attack is detected using meta-hyperparameter random forest (MHP-RF) classifier. Once the attack is detected, the transaction information is stored in server securely by means of smart contract-based blockchain system. The transaction handling stage classifies the transaction type as normal or abnormal one which then followed by execution of business logic by smart contract thereby appending the transaction of blockchain in the network cloud. The consensus blockchain technique is employed with the use of PoW-enabled scheme integrated with Elgamal-based data aggregation. Therefore, the system security is improved and the intrusion is prevented greatly. The performance analysis of the system is analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, Encryption time, decryption time, execution time, and space complexity. The attained outcomes are compared with traditional approaches to prove the effectiveness of proposed strategy. The proposed system is said to be effective in time consumption, classifier performance, and in overcoming space complexity issues.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a developing technology that provides the simplicity and benefits of exchanging data with other devices using the cloud or wireless networks. However, the changes and developments in the IoT environment are making IoT systems susceptible to cyber attacks which could possibly lead to malicious intrusions. The impacts of these intrusions could lead to physical and economical damages. This article primarily focuses on the IoT system/framework, the IoT, learning-based methods, and the difficulties faced by the IoT devices or systems after the occurrence of an attack. Learning-based methods are reviewed using different types of cyber attacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), probing, user-to-root (U2R), remoteto-local (R2L), botnet attack, spoofing, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. For learning-based methods, both machine and deep learning methods are presented and analyzed in relation to the detection of cyber attacks in IoT systems. A comprehensive list of publications to date in the literature is integrated to present a complete picture of various developments in this area. Finally, future research directions are also provided in the paper.},

	abstract = {The emergence of the IoT, cloud systems, data centers, and 5G networks is increasing the demand for a rapid development of new applications and protocols at all levels of the protocol stack. However, traditional fixed function data planes have been characterized by a lengthy and costly development process at the hand of few chip manufacturers. Recently, data plane programmability has attracted significant attention, permitting network owners to run customized packet processing functions using P4, the de facto data plane programming language. Network security is one of the key research areas exploiting the capabilities of programmable switches. Examples include new encapsulations and secure tunnels implemented in short times, mitigation techniques for DDoS attacks that occur at terabit rates, customized firewalls that track hundreds of thousands of connections per second, and traffic anonymization systems that operate at line rate. Moreover, applications can be reconfigured in the field without additional hardware upgrades, facilitating the deployment of new defenses against unforeseen attacks and vulnerabilities. Furthermore, these security applications are designed by network owners who can meet their specific requirements, rather than by chip manufacturers.Despite the impressive advantages of programmable data plane switches, the literature has been missing a comprehensive survey on security applications. To this end, this paper provides a concise background on programmable switches and their main features that are relevant to security. It then presents a taxonomy that surveys, classifies, and analyzes articles related to security applications developed with P4. Additionally, the paper employs a STRIDE analysis to examine vulnerabilities related to general P4 applications (e.g., congestion control, load balancing, in-network cache) and proposes plausible remediation approaches. Furthermore, challenges associated with programmable data planes, the impact of these challenges on security implementations, and schemes to eliminate or mitigate them are discussed. Finally, the paper discusses future endeavors and open research problems.},

	abstract = {Multi-tenancy and the vulnerabilities of network isolation make Low-Rate Distributed Denial-of-Service (LDDoS) severe threats to cloud data centers. Due to the stealthy nature of the LDDoS attack, it is not easy to detect in data center networks (DCN) with frequent Incast traffic. And the traditional Detect-Drop defense strategy may drop some benign flows, significantly reducing user experience. To this end, this paper first proposes a mathematical model that reveals the attack aggregation mechanism and queuing pattern of LDDoS attack in DCN. On this basis, this article proposes a novel defense strategy that can interfere with LDDoS attack aggregation without breaking the benign user's connection. When there is an attack detected, the information of normal and suspicious flows will be roughly grouped and notified to the preceding switch, where they will enter different switch queues separately. Afterward, the packets in the suspicious flow queue will be added with a subtle delay when dequeuing. As for the attack flows, it directly results in the inability to aggregate into large pulses. For the normal flow, it merely increases the flow completion time (FCT) by a few microseconds. It is due to this property that the method proposed can defend against attacks without affecting the connection of the normal flows. The simulation results are consistent with the theoretical analysis and show that this strategy can effectively recover the network performance. Moreover, it achieves excellent robustness at low detection accuracy, making it suitable for running in DCN.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new comprehensive realistic cyber security dataset of IoT and IIoT applications, called Edge-IIoTset, which can be used by machine learning-based intrusion detection systems in two different modes, namely, centralized and federated learning. Specifically, the dataset has been generated using a purpose-built IoT/IIoT testbed with a large representative set of devices, sensors, protocols and cloud/edge configurations. The IoT data are generated from various IoT devices (more than 10 types) such as Low-cost digital sensors for sensing temperature and humidity, Ultrasonic sensor, Water level detection sensor, pH Sensor Meter, Soil Moisture sensor, Heart Rate Sensor, Flame Sensor, etc.). Furthermore, we identify and analyze fourteen attacks related to IoT and IIoT connectivity protocols, which are categorized into five threats, including, DoS/DDoS attacks, Information gathering, Man in the middle attacks, Injection attacks, and Malware attacks. In addition, we extract features obtained from different sources, including alerts, system resources, logs, network traffic, and propose new 61 features with high correlations from 1176 found features. After processing and analyzing the proposed realistic cyber security dataset, we provide a primary exploratory data analysis and evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches (i.e., traditional machine learning as well as deep learning) in both centralized and federated learning modes. The Edge-IIoTset dataset can be publicly accessed from http://ieee-dataport.org/8939.},

	abstract = {The distributed denial of service attack poses a significant threat to network security. Despite the availability of various methods for detecting DDoS attacks, the challenge remains in creating real-time detectors with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, the effectiveness of new detection methods depends heavily on well-constructed datasets. This paper addresses the critical DDoS dataset creation and evaluation domain, focusing on the cloud network. After conducting an in-depth analysis of 16 publicly available datasets, this research identifies 15 shortcomings across various dimensions, emphasizing the need for a new approach to dataset creation. Building upon this understanding, this paper introduces a new public DDoS dataset named BCCC-cPacket-Cloud-DDoS-2024. This dataset is meticulously crafted, addressing challenges identified in previous datasets through a cloud infrastructure featuring over eight benign user activities and 17 DDoS attack scenarios. Also, a Benign User Profiler (BUP) tool has been designed and developed to generate benign user network traffic based on a normal user behavior profile. We manually label the dataset and extract over 300 features from the network and transport layers of the traffic flows using NTLFlowLyzer. The experimental phase involves identifying an optimal feature set using three distinct algorithms: ANOVA, information gain, and extra tree. Finally, this paper proposes a multi-layered DDoS detection model and evaluates its performance using the generated dataset to cover the main issues of the traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can largely damage the availability of the cloud services and can be effectively initiated by utilizing different tools, prompting financial harm or influencing the reputation. Consequently, there is a requirement for a more grounded and general approach to block these attacks. This paper proposes the use of artificial immune systems to alleviate DDoS attacks in cloud computing by identifying the most potential features of the attack. This methodology is capable of detecting threats and responding according to the behavior of the biological resistance mechanism in human beings. It is carried out by emulating the various immune reactions and the construction of the intrusion detection system. For the assessment, experiments with public domain datasets (KDD cup 99) were implemented. Based on broad theoretical and performance analysis, the proposed system is capable to identify the anomalous entries with high detection accuracy and low false alarm rate.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are some of the biggest threats to network performance and security today. With the advent of cloud computing, these attacks can be performed remotely on rented virtual machines (VMs), potentially increasing their capabilities and making them harder to trace and mitigate, and negatively affecting the cloud service provider as well. By analyzing packet transmission statistics, attacks can be detected on a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that controls the behavior of the VMs. This article proposes a solution to stop such detected attacks from the source, and analyses solutions proposed for a few different types of such attacks. The authors propose a model called selective cloud egress filter (SCEF) which implements specific modules to deal with detected attacks. If an attack is detected, the SCEF relays information to the VMM about which VMs are participating in the attack, allowing for specific corrective action.},

	abstract = {Network slicing is envisaged as the key to unlocking revenue growth in 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. However, the dynamic nature of network slicing and the growing sophistication of DDoS attacks rises the menace of reshaping a stealthy DDoS into an Economical Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attack. EDoS aims at incurring economic damages to service provider due to the increased elastic use of resources. Motivated by the limitations of existing defense solutions, we propose FortisEDoS, a novel framework that aims at enabling elastic B5G services that are impervious to EDoS attacks. FortisEDoS integrates a new deep learning-powered DDoS anomaly detection model, dubbed CG-GRU, that capitalizes on the capabilities of emerging graph and recurrent neural networks in capturing spatio-temporal correlations to accurately discriminate malicious behavior. Furthermore, FortisEDoS leverages transfer learning to effectively defeat EDoS attacks in newly deployed slices by exploiting the knowledge learned in a previously deployed slice. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CG-GRU in achieving higher detection performance of more than 92\% with lower computation complexity. They show also that transfer learning can yield an attack detection sensitivity of above 91\%, while accelerating the training process by at least 61\%. Further analysis shows that FortisEDoS exhibits intuitive explainability of its decisions, fostering trust in deep learning-assisted systems.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the massive surge of interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), this work focuses on the kinetics of its security. By automating everything, starting from baby monitors to life-saving medical devices, IoT brought convenience to people's lives and rapidly became a trillion-dollar industry. However, the future of IoT will be decided on how its security and privacy concerns are dealt with. It is a fact that at present, the security of IoT is lacking in coherent and logical perspectives. For example, the researchers do not adequately accommodate the uncertainty and insider attacks while developing the IoT security procedures, even though most security concerns related to IoT arise from an insider and uncertain habitat. This paper provides a critical analysis of the most recent and relevant state-of-art methods of IoT security and identifies the parameters that are crucial for any security posture in IoT. Considering all the intricate details of IoT environments, this work proposes a Generic and Lightweight Security mechanism for detecting malicious behavior in the uncertain IoT using a Fuzzy Logic- and Fog-based approach (GLSF(2)IoT). It is developed on the principle of ``zero trust,{''} i.e., trust nothing and treat everything as hostile. While Fuzzy Logic has been used to remove uncertainties, the Fog-IoT architecture makes GLSF(2)IoT inherently better than the cloud-IoT. Once the malicious activity is detected, GLSF(2)IoT automatically limits the network access against the IoT device that initiated this activity, preventing it from targeting other devices. We evaluated GLSF(2)IoT for blackhole, selective forward, collusion and DDoS attacks, i.e., attacks which can invalidate any IoT architecture. Besides yielding better accuracy results than the existing benchmarks, we found that GLSF(2)IoT puts extremely low pressure on the constrained nodes, is scalable, supports heterogeneity, and uncertainty of the IoT environments.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection systems aim to detect and report attacks or unexpected behavior in networked systems. Previous work has shown that anomalies have an impact on system performance, and that performance signatures can be effectively used for implementing an IDS. In this paper, we present an analytical and an experimental study on the trade-off between anomaly detection based on performance signatures and system scalability. The proposed approach combines analytical modeling and load testing to find optimal configurations for the signature-based IDS. We apply a heavy-tail bi-modal modeling approach, where ``long{''} jobs represent large resource consuming transactions, e.g., generated by DDoS attacks; the model was parametrized using results obtained from controlled experiments. For performance purposes, mean response time is the key metric to be minimized, whereas for security purposes, response time variance and classification accuracy must be taken into account. The key insights from our analysis are: (i) there is an optimal number of servers which minimizes the response time variance, (ii) the sweet-spot number of servers that minimizes response time variance and maximizes classification accuracy is typically smaller than or equal to the one that minimizes mean response time. Therefore, for security purposes, it may be worth slightly sacrificing performance to increase classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing makes it easier for users to access resources from anywhere at any time. This is for as long as they have access to the internet connectivity by employing a ``pay-as-you-use{''} model. Despite its merits, cloud computing faces shortcomings, notably the escalating security concerns linked with it. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a primary and biggest concert to the availability of the services offered by cloud. DDoS attacks use numerous machines to flood consumers with packets with high data overhead, flooding the network with unwanted traffic. Due to the obsolete datasets, many deep learning (DL) models are processing-intensive or may not successfully address new DDoS threats. This paper seeks to address this issue by proposing FEwDN, an AI-based DDoS detection framework that employs a hybrid approach, integrating machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The framework optimizes feature selection via ensemble techniques, enhancing accuracy by leveraging deep neural networks for traffic classification. The proposed framework is experimented on the CICDDoS2019 dataset and demonstrates superior performance over benchmark techniques across multiple metrics. The FEwDN outperforms well with other models against various performance metrics. This research strengthens cloud security and DDoS detection in modern clouds.},

	abstract = {In the era of evolution of information technologies (IT), cloud computing plays a vital role in providing services through the internet. Cloud computing has many challenges, the major is security issues. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is one of the most attacks treating cloud systems, it is able to make the service unavailable. So, it is necessary to deploy a mechanism of defense to detect these attacks earliest. Serval DDoS detection methods are challenged by the huge number of network flows generated by different distributed devices and high false-positive rate. In this paper, we present anomaly-based detection method of DDoS attack in the cloud environment based on a combination of deep neural networks and machine learning algorithms to improve accuracy and reduce false-positive rate, we evaluate our approach with various experiments were performed on the CIDDS-001 dataset. The approach conducted a satisfactory result accuracy of 0.99, a f1-score of 0.99.},

	abstract = {The present research proposes a detective approach to analyzing the performance of various algorithms used for more accurate detection of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud computing. From the start, this study uses machine learning and deep learning to explore whether information security has evolved in recent years. The deployment of intrusion detection systems and distributed denial-of-service attacks are then discussed. The most common DDoS attack types were summarized. In addition, this study reviewed the existing approaches and techniques for DDoS attack detection. Various pre-processing subsystems as well as attribute-based selection techniques for preventing the detection of DDoS were briefly described. The proposed Intrusion detection system uses transfer learning for detecting DDoS attacks in the Networks. The proposed system used for the data set for the Network Intrusion Detection System is SDN Dataset which has more features and is suitable to use to detect in Network Intrusions. It contains 23 features that are used to detect Intrusions in the network SDN Dataset which consists of training and testing data to detect the attacks in the network. The detection and prevention subsystems through ML and DL strategies were briefly discussed. The proposed deep learning model for DDoS attack detection in cloud storage applications is explained. After that, various preprocessing strategies employed in the detection are described, among them rebalancing data, data cleaning, data splitting, and data normalization like min-max normalization. The author created a hypermodel that consists the parameters of baseline classifiers like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, XGboost, and other various machine learning models. The proposed model gives very good accuracy compared to other machine learning models.},

	abstract = {Internet security is a major concern these days due to the increasing demand for information technology (IT)-based platforms and cloud computing. With its expansion, the Internet has been facing various types of attacks. Viruses, denial of service (DoS) attacks, distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, code injection attacks, and spoofing are the most common types of attacks in the modern era. Due to the expansion of IT, the volume and severity of network attacks have been increasing lately. DoS and DDoS are the most frequently reported network traffic attacks. Traditional solutions such as intrusion detection systems and firewalls cannot detect complex DDoS and DoS attacks. With the integration of artificial intelligence-based machine learning and deep learning methods, several novel approaches have been presented for DoS and DDoS detection. In particular, deep learning models have played a crucial role in detecting DDoS attacks due to their exceptional performance. This study adopts deep learning models including recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gradient recurrent unit (GRU) to detect DDoS attacks on the most recent dataset, CICDDoS2019, and a comparative analysis is conducted with the CICIDS2017 dataset. The comparative analysis contributes to the development of a competent and accurate method for detecting DDoS attacks with reduced execution time and complexity. The experimental results demonstrate that models perform equally well on the CICDDoS2019 dataset with an accuracy score of 0.99, but there is a difference in execution time, with GRU showing less execution time than those of RNN and LSTM.},

However, protecting the cloud network against anomalies remains a challenge. Unlike traditional detection techniques, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) offer new and adaptable methods for detecting anomalies in cloud networks. The objective of this study is to comprehensively explore existing ML /DL methods for detecting different anomalies based on distributed denial of service anomaly (DDoS) and intrusion detection systems (IDS) in cloud networks. The study seeks to address the gaps in anomaly detection for cloud networks, proposing potential solutions for anomaly detection in these cloud environments. The ultimate goal is to contribute valuable insights and practical solutions to enhance the security and reliability of cloud networks through effective anomaly detection by ML/ DL techniques. Methodologies for ML/DL are explained, along with their advantages, disadvantages, and respective approaches. In addition, a summary of the comparison between different ML/ DL models is also included.},

	abstract = {Network monitoring is crucial to analyze infrastructure baselines and alert whenever an abnormal behavior is observed. However, human effort is limited in time and scope since many variables must be considered in real-time. In addition, infrastructures such as Kubernetes are complex by nature since they do not consider fixed equipment from which to gather data; instead, these infrastructures consider distributed, event-driven, and ephemeral containers that make it complicated to capture and track metrics. Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated high detection rates for anomaly detection; therefore, there is a need to design and implement a global solution to collect complex data and orchestrate the whole Machine Learning Operations workflow. This document shares the findings and learnings from defining a cloud-native Artificial Intelligence infrastructure at Aligo to develop an anomaly-based detection system for monitoring on-premise Kubernetes infrastructures. After Chaos Engineering experiments, it is shown that the resulting deployed system is strong when alerting outliers and that an end-to-end infrastructure has been developed for conducting future Artificial Intelligence projects at the company.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection (ID) on the cloud environment has received paramount interest over the last few years. Among the latest approaches, machine learning-based ID methods allow us to discover unknown attacks. However, due to the lack of malicious samples and the rapid evolution of diverse attacks, constructing a cloud ID system (IDS) that is robust to a wide range of unknown attacks remains challenging. In this article, we propose a novel solution to enable robust cloud IDSs using deep neural networks. Specifically, we develop two deep generative models to synthesize malicious samples on the cloud systems. The first model, conditional denoising adversarial autoencoder (CDAAE), is used to generate specific types of malicious samples. The second model (CDAEE-KNN) is a hybrid of CDAAE and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm to generate malicious borderline samples that further improve the accuracy of a cloud IDS. The synthesized samples are merged with the original samples to form the augmented datasets. Three machine learning algorithms are trained on the augmented datasets and their effectiveness is analyzed. The experiments conducted on four popular IDS datasets show that our proposed techniques significantly improve the accuracy of the cloud IDSs compared with the baseline technique and the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, our models also enhance the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in detecting some currently challenging distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, including low-rate DDoS attacks and application layer DDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a challenging threat to the availability and performance of cloud-based Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). Detection and classification of DDoS attacks in such dynamic and highly virtualized environments is critical to maintaining network stability and ensuring uninterrupted services. Therefore, this study develops a metaheuristic with Multi-Layer Ensemble Deep Reinforcement Learning for DDoS Attack Detection and Mitigation (MMEDRL-ADM) technique in the Cloud SDN Environment. The presented MMEDRL-ADM technique leverages metaheuristics with deep learning model for the recognition of DDoS attacks in the SDN data plane. To accomplish this, the presented MMEDRL-ADM technique initially preprocesses the network data. Next, the MMEDRL-ADM technique designs African buffalo optimization algorithm-based feature selection (ABO-FS) to reduce the computation complexity and increase the detection rate. For DDoS attack detection, the multilayer ensemble deep reinforcement learning (MEDRL) technique is used. To adjust the hyperparameter values of the MEDRL technique, an improved grasshopper optimization algorithm (IGOA) is exploited. The design of MEDRL approach with IGOA based hyperparameter tuning demonstrates the novelty of the work. The experimental validation of the MMEDRL-ADM system is tested under a benchmark dataset. The comparison study highlighted the improved performance of the MMEDRL-ADM technique over other models.},

Furthermore, many of the contemporary detection and prevention solutions, while innovative, remain anchored to dedicated workstations, lacking the flexibility and scalability required in today's digital landscape. To bridge this technological chasm, this research introduces a state-of-the-art intrusion detection system firmly rooted in advanced Deep Learning techniques. By leveraging the expansive and adaptable nature of cloud-centric, service-oriented architectures, we not only bolster detection precision but also offer a solution designed for modern infrastructures.

	year = {2021},

	abstract = {Cloud computing model provides on demand, elastic and fully managed computer system resources and services to organizations. However, attacks on cloud components can cause inestimable losses to cloud service providers and cloud users. One such category of attacks is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which can have serious consequences including impaired customer experience, service outage and in severe cases, complete shutdown and total economic unsustainability. Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and network connectivity have inadvertently facilitated launch of DDoS attacks which have increased in volume, frequency and intensity. Recent DDoS attacks involving new attack vectors and strategies, have precipitated the need for this survey. In this survey, we mainly focus on finding the gaps, as well as bridging those gaps between the future potential DDoS attacks and state-of-the-art scientific and commercial DDoS attack defending solutions. It seeks to highlight the need for a comprehensive detection approach by presenting the recent threat landscape and major cloud attack incidents, estimates of future DDoS, illustrative use cases, commercial DDoS solutions, and the laws governing DDoS attacks in different nations. An upto-date survey of DDoS detection methods, particularly anomaly based detection, available research tools, platforms and datasets, has been given. This paper further explores the use of machine learning methods for detection of DDoS attacks and investigates features, strengths, weaknesses, tools, datasets, and evaluates results of the methods in the context of the cloud. A summary comparison of statistical, machine learning and hybrid methods has been brought forth based on detailed analysis. This paper is intended to serve as a ready reference for the research community to develop effective and innovative detection mechanisms for forthcoming DDoS attacks in the cloud environment. It will also sensitize cloud users and providers to the urgent need to invest in deployment of DDoS detection mechanisms to secure their assets. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Through deployment of fifth-generation (5G) networks (providing wide broadband, low latency, and massive machine type communications), industrial wireless networks, cloud, and fixed/mobile end devices in smart factories are interoperated in a harmony. However, with the huge-scale deployment of 5G networks and the IIoT in smart factories, threats and attacks against various vulnerabilities increase enormously, and cause considerable security and privacy challenges. Consequently, this article investigates crucial security and privacy issues for 5G-IIoT smart factories in three entities (i.e., physical layer, data layer and application layer), and further surveys recent approaches based on deep learning, reinforcement learning, and blockchain. In addition, this article provides future perspectives and challenges along this line of research.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a progressive technology that offers computing resources as Internet-based services, revolutionized information, and communication technologies. From an economic standpoint, this transformation is beneficial because it allows them to streamline technology infrastructure and capital costs. However, economical denial of service (EDoS) potential is a crucial impediment to cloud computing success. Several improved ways to detect EDoS and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the cloud have been presented; nevertheless, these approaches still result in a considerable reduction in detection accuracy when employed in a cloud setting. Because selecting relevant features and precise classifiers for attack detection is a challenge. We recommend using an EDoS and DDoS attack identification framework in the cloud based on optimized deep learning techniques for higher detection accuracy. The experimental results reveal True Positive Rate (TPR) varies from 98.9\% to 99.8\% when using deep belief network with support vector machine as a learning mechanism, while True Negative Rate (TNR) from 99.6\% to 99.9\%. TPR and TNR were found to have average values of 99.32\% and 99.67\%, respectively. At 1600 requests/s, the maximum accuracy achieved and the overall accuracy of the proposed strategy was 99.78\%.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence can be considered a leading component of industrial transformation, but its application is also present in other areas, such as the telecommunications sector. Methodologies based on artificial intelligence, the most significant of which is machine learning, support these areas when predicting maintenance needs and reducing downtime. Machine learning has many algorithms and methods of its own. This research presents machine learning methods and the possibilities of their use in the areas of telecommunications and Industry 4.0. With the improvement of new technologies such as higher internet speeds and 5G mobile networks in the field of telecommunications or Industry 4.0, comes the need for new and improved management and support for systems that use these new technologies. The possibilities of current Artificial Intelligence of Things devices and distributed execution of ML algorithms using Edge/Fog/Cloud computing environments are being considered. Some types of machine learning can be used for collecting data to improve user's quality of service. Also, some types of them can be used to collect data on network traffic or, in general, for any system that needs to collect data, cluster data points, and analyze data.},

	abstract = {In today's digital era, most electrical gadgets have become smart, and the great majority of them can connect to the internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network comprised of interconnected items. Cloud-based IoT infrastructures are vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Despite the fact that these devices may be accessed from anywhere, they are vulnerable to assault and compromise. DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to network security and operational integrity. DDoS assault in which infected botnets of networks hit the victim's PC from several systems across the internet, is one of the most popular. In this paper, three prominent datasets: UNSW-NB 15, UNSW-2018 IoT Botnet and recent Edge IIoT are using in an Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection system(AIDS) to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. AIDS employ machine learning methods and Deep Learning (DL) for attack mitigation. The suggested work employed different types of machine learning and Deep Learning (DL): Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), deep Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) methods to identify DDoS attacks. Both of these methods are contrasted by the fact that the database stores the trained signatures. As a results, RF shows a promising performance with 100\% accuracy and a minimum false positive on testing both datasets UNSW-NB 15 and UNSW-2018 Botnet. In addition, the results for a realistic Edge IIoT dataset show a good performance in accuracy for RF 98.79\% and for deep learning LSTM with 99.36\% in minimum time compared with other results for multi-class detection.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks disrupt global network services by mainly overwhelming the victim host with requests originating from multiple traffic sources. DDoS attacks are currently on the rise due to the ease of execution and rental of distributed architectures such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud infrastructures, which could potentially result in substantial revenue losses. Therefore, the detection and prevention of DDoS attacks are currently topics of high interest. In this study, we use traffic flow information to determine if a specific flow is associated with a DDoS attack. We used traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods in developing our DDoS detector and applied an exhaustive hyperparameter search to optimize their detection capability. Using lightweight approaches is suitable for resource-constrained environments such as IoT to reduce computing overhead. Our evaluation shows that most algorithms provide satisfactory results, with Random Forests achieving as high as 99\% of detection accuracy, which is similar to the performance of current deep learning solutions for DDoS detection.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks represent the most common and critical attacks targeting conventional and new generation networks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and fifth-generation (5G) communication networks. In recent years, DDoS attacks have become not only massive but also sophisticated. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology has demonstrated effectiveness in counter-measuring complex attacks since it provides flexibility on global network monitoring and inline network configuration. Although several works have proposed to detect DDoS attacks, most of them did not use up-to-date datasets that contain the newest threats. Furthermore, only a few previous works assessed their solutions using simulated scenarios, easing the migration to production networks. This document presents the implementation of a modular and flexible SDN-based architecture to detect transport and application layer DDoS attacks using multiple Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. Exploring diverse ML/DL methods allowed us to resolve which methods perform better under different attack types and conditions. We tested the ML/DL models using two up-to-date security datasets, namely CICDoS2017 and CICDDoS2019 datasets, and they showed accuracy above 99\% on classifying unseen traffic (testing set). We also deployed a simulated environment using the network emulator Mininet and the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) SDN controller. In this experimental setup, we demonstrated high detection rates, above 98\% for transport DDoS attacks and up to 95\% for application-layer DDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {As a result of the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things, there are now hundreds of millions of connected devices, increasing the likelihood that they may be vulnerable to various types of cyberattacks. In recent years, distributed denial of service (DDoS) has emerged as one of the most destructive tools utilized by attackers. Traditional machine learning approaches are typically ineffective and unable to cope with actual traffic properties when used to identify DDoS attacks. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based intrusion detection system, specifically designed for deployment at either the Cloud or Fog level in the IoT environment. The proposed model aims to detect all types of DDoS attacks with their specific subcategory. Our hybrid model combines different types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Autoencoder, and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Our proposed model is made up of two main levels. The first one contains different parallel sub-neural networks trained with specific algorithms. The second level uses the output of the frozen first level combined with the initial data as input. The idea behind the combination of these various types of deep neural networks is to exploit their different properties to achieve very high performance. To evaluate our model, we used the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, which satisfies all the constraints of an intrusion detection dataset. The results obtained demonstrate that our proposed model outperformed various well-known machine learning and deep learning models in terms of the true positive rate, accuracy, false alarm rate, average accuracy, and average detection rate.},

	abstract = {The emergence of the Mirai malware facilitated a DDoS attack vector to surge to almost 1 Tbps in 2016, instigated by less than 150,000 infected IoT devices. With the infection of five new IoT devices per minute, the size of Mirai botnet was enlarged to 2.5 millions devices by the end of 2016. The continuous adaptation of the Mirai malware enables the modern variant to dynamically update its malware scripts on the fly to launch even more advanced and malevolent DDoS attacks, which dramatically escalates the level of difficulty with mitigating DDoS attacks. Many researchers endeavour to develop mitigation systems to keep up with the increasing security threats. Nonetheless, most presented models provide inefficient solutions either by utilising auxiliary servers at the host site, on the cloud or at dedicated data scrubbing centres. Since internet service providers (ISPs) connect the internet with users, the mitigation system should be deployed within the ISP domain to deliver a more efficient solution. Accordingly, we propose a stacked self-organising map, which is a feature dynamic deep learning approach that utilises netflow data collected by the ISP to combat the dynamic nature of novel DDoS attacks.},

To prevent DDoS attack, real-time analysis of the cloud network traffic is fundamental. Machine learning techniques are an effective solution to develop a robust Intrusion detection system in cloud computing systems. This paper proposed a machine learning framework, explores the possibility of utilizing a machine learning classifier to detect the DDoS attack on cloud computing systems; first by the full dimensions of the features, second by reducing these dimensions. Our framework is characterized by a high accurate rate in detecting emerging DDoS attacks, and its lightweight algorithm.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have laid the flagstone for the fourth industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. The industry 4.0 is at a very high momentum when compared to previous revolutions witnessed by humans in a way which was never anticipated. Cyber Physical Systems and Cloud computing are the basis for Industry 4.0. An ongoing research challenge in cloud computing is the immediate need to address security and data availability challenges coined in modern networking environments. For instance, DDoS at-tacks in cloud are continuously throwing new challenges to network community which makes detection of these attacks, an ongoing research challenge with respect to cloud security. At the outset, the research reported in this work has addressed three important contributions (i) A new gaussian based traffic attribute-pattern similarity function for evolutionary feature clustering to achieve feature transformation-based dimensionality reduction, (ii) A Gaussian based network traffic similarity function for similarity computation between network traffic instances and (iii) A machine learning model SWASTHIKA which uses feature transformation traffic for detection of low rate and high-rate network attacks. For experimental study, the most recent benchmark dataset namely IoT DoS and DDoS attack dataset available at IEEE Dataport is considered as this dataset has highly non-linear traffic instances which are like the real-world traffic. The perfor-mance evaluation of the proposed machine learning model SWASTHIKA is done by considering various classifier evaluation parameters such as accuracy, precision, detection rate, and F-Score. The experiment results proved that the attack detection rate of SWASTHIKA is significantly better compared to state of art machine learning classifiers.},

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) nowadays is extensively being used in a variety of practical settings, provides a new way to manage networks by separating the data plane from its control plane. However, SDN is particularly vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks because of its centralized control logic. Many studies have been proposed to tackle DDoS attacks in an SDN design using machine-learning-based schemes; however, these feature-based detection schemes are highly resource-intensive and they are unable to perform reliably in such a large-scale SDN network where a massive amount of traffic data is generated from both control and data planes. This can deplete computing resources, degrade network performance, or even shut down the network systems owing to being exhausting resources. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a big data framework to overcome traditional data processing limitations and to exploit distributed resources effectively for the most compute-intensive tasks such as DDoS attack detection using machine learning techniques, etc. We demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and effectiveness of our framework through practical experiments.},

	abstract = {The detection and identification of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks remains a challenge in cloud/edge/fog computing environments. It usually requires network middleboxes, such as deep packet inspectors (DPI), for detection task mostly. But clouds and fogs have native powerful telemetry systems that are not yet fully exploited for DDoS detection; and provide so much information that could aid attack identification tasks as well. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can help one diving into the richness of cloud's native data collection services, which have a multitude of metrics from both physical and virtual hosts. This paper evaluates the use of ML algorithms over datasets collected from a experimental testbed based on OpenStack. Controlled attack scenarios were used to investigate the ability of ML for tasks such as detecting and identifying SYN\_Flood and GET\_Flood DDoS attacks mixed, in different proportions, with legitimate clients. kNN and Random Forest ML algorithms were trained and tested, and for evaluation the metrics accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score were used. Our experiments presented about 87\% of accuracy in the detection of SYN\_Flood and GET\_Flood DDoS attacks, whereas Snort IDS mostly fails to detect the latter attack by processing the corresponding packet traces. Also, the detection of PING\_Flood DDoS attack was tested without training as an initial evaluation towards the generalization of the proposal.},

With digital forensics, attack detection faced a new challenge by the exponential growth of network traffic and its many forms on the Internet. The highest True Negative Rate, accuracy, and precision are calculated in this paper. We propose an Attack Classification in Cloud Network Environment method based on machine learning with a digital forensic process. True Negative Rate, accuracy, and precision are all excellent in our detection process, according to our findings. Therefore, our proposed fusion (Digital Forensics based on deep learning) algorithm works well as a data classification detective. Our model performed state-of-the-art attack detection techniques in terms of overall detection performance, detection stability, and system generalization capability.},

By employing the IRBM architecture and a trust-oriented secure cloud framework, the work utilizes parameter tuning in RBM through the Gradient-Based Optimization (GBO) algorithm resulting in the proposed IRBM-GBO model. This model significantly outperforms SVM, SC-CNSP-ML, and RBM in terms of latency and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), showing 21.67\%, 14.55\%, and 9.62\% improvements in latency, and 10.23\%, 5.43\%, and 12.79\% in PDR, respectively. The research highlights the potential of combining soft computing with deep learning and cloud technologies to identify cyberattacks by emphasising improvements in latency, Quality of Service (QoS), throughput, and PDR across various cybersecurity datasets.},

	abstract = {DDoS attacks have emerged as the most serious Internet risks, causing significant damage to businesses and governments. This study utilized the BoT-IoT dataset obtained from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) website on machine learning (ML) algorithms to prevent HTTP-based DDoS attacks in the Internet of Things environment. Character encoding was performed to convert the strings such as DDoS attack to 1 and Non-malicious to 0. Feature scaling and normalization were carried out to normalize numerical data with large values using a Python module called standard scaler to avoid model overfitting or underfitting. According to the performance evaluation metrics results, decision tree is the best model with 99.96\% accuracy, 0.9979 R-2, 0.0003 MAE, 0.0003 MSE, 0.0195 RMSE, 1.0 precision, 0.9994 recall, 0.9997 F1\_score after dimensionality reduction. After comparing various ML models, this study concludes that the decision tree is the golden model for HTTP-based DDoS attack prevention in IoT devices. The study recommends the utilization of other performance evaluation metrics such as Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Kappa Statistic and Huber loss for further studies to avoid bias and subjectivity in the model selection where there are surrogate models. Also, deep learning paradigms can be implemented for the prevention of HTTP-based DDoS attacks in cloud environments.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks still prevailing in Internet based and cloud based applications. To detect such attacks and mitigate their effect, many approaches came into existence. There are signature based methods, metrics based methods and machine learning (ML) based methods. With the availability of training data, ML based solutions, of late, became popular. However, there is need for evaluation of different ML models for real time usage in distributed applications. We proposed a ML based framework that has mechanisms, including feature selection, to have supervised learning for threat detection. The framework enables workflow required to pre-process data, select essential features, train ML classifiers and detect the DDoS attack and classify it. We also proposed an algorithm known as DDoS Attack Detection for Critical Services Protection (DAD-CSP) that takes dataset and ML pipeline as input, exploits the ML models and evaluates them. Feature selection has resulted in dimensionality reduction for improving quality in training. The ML models such as Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest showed different capabilities in attack classification. RF exhibited highest performance with 92\% accuracy when compared with other two models.},

	abstract = {In the current situation, digital technology is a necessary component of daily life for people. During the Covid-19 pandemic, every profit and non-profit making businesses organizations moved online, which caused an exponential rise in incursions and attacks on the digital platform. The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which may quickly paralyse Internetbased services and applications, is one of the deadly threats to emerge. The attackers regularly update their skill tactics, which allows them to get around the current detection and protection systems. The standard detection systems are ineffective for identifying novel DDoS attacks since the volume of data generated and stored has multiplied. So, the main goal of this work is to employ data fusion applications for secure cloud services and demonstrate the detection of DDoS attacks with the applications of machine learning classifiers that can further be helpful for cloud forensic investigation process. A variety of machine learning models, including decision trees, Navies Bayes, SVM, and KNN are used to detect and classify cloud DDoS attacks. The outcomes of the experiments demonstrated that decision tree is the most feasible and better performer method to classify cloud DDoS attacks.},

It employs deep learning techniques, notably CNN-LSTM-Transformer networks, to predict network traffic entropy and detect potential attacks. The framework uses a genetic algorithm for optimal feature selection, enhancing the efficacy of the AutoCNN-DT model in distinguishing between normal and attack traffic. Tested on the CIDDS-001 traffic dataset, DeepDefend demonstrates high accuracy in entropy forecasting and rapid, precise detection of DDoS attacks. This integrated approach combines time series analysis, genetic algorithms, and deep learning, offering a robust solution to protect cloud computing infrastructure against DDoS threats.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks disrupt the availability of cloud services. The detection of these attacks is a major challenge in the cloud computing environment. Machine learning models can be used to detect these attacks efficiently. In this work, a hybrid machine learning model based approach to detect these attacks is proposed. Firstly, a hybrid machine learning model using extreme learning machine (ELM) and adaptive differential evolution is proposed. In the proposed model, input to hidden layer link weights, and hidden layer biases of ELM are optimized using adaptive differential evolution while weights of links between hidden and output layers are analytically determined. The adaptive differential evolution is modified to choose the apt crossover operator during the evolution process. After that, a DDoS attack detection system using the suggested hybrid model is proposed for cloud computing.. Three state-of-the-art datasets NSL-KDD, ISCX IDS 2012, and CIDDS-001 are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed attack detection system.},

	abstract = {The demand for internet security has escalated in the last two decades because the rapid proliferation in the number of internet users has presented attackers with new detrimental opportunities. One of the simple yet powerful attacks lurking around the internet today is the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. The expeditious surge in the collaborative environments, like IoT, cloud computing, and SDN, have provided attackers with countless new avenues to benefit from the distributed nature of DDoS attacks. The attackers protect their anonymity by infecting distributed devices and utilizing them to create a bot army to constitute a large-scale attack. Thus, the development of an effective as well as efficient DDoS defense mechanism becomes an immediate goal. In this exposition, the authors present a DDoS threat analysis along with a few novel ground-breaking defense mechanisms proposed by various researchers for numerous domains. Further, they talk about popular performance metrics that evaluate the defense schemes. In the end, they list prevalent DDoS attack tools and open challenges.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of service attack(DDoS)is a network security attack and now the attackers intruded into almost every technology such as cloud computing, IoT, and edge computing to make themselves stronger. As per the behaviour of DDoS, all the available resources like memory, cpu or may be the entire network are consumed by the attacker in order to shutdown the victim's machine or server. Though, the plenty of defensive mechanism are proposed, but they are not efficient as the attackers get themselves trained by the newly available automated attacking tools. Therefore, we proposed a classification based machine learning approach for detection of DDoS attack in cloud computing. With the help of three classification machine learning algorithms K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Naive Bayes, the mechanism can detect a DDoS attack with the accuracy of 99.76\%.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, fog computing plays a very vital role in providing many services to end-based IoT (Internet of ings) systems. The end IoTdevices communicate with the middle layer fog nodes and to the above cloud layer to process the user tasks. However, this large data communication experiences many security challenges as IoT devices are being compromised and thus the fog nodes at the fog layer are more prone to a very critical attack known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The attackers or the compromised IoT devices need to be detected well in the network. Deep Learning (DL) plays a prominent role in predicting the end-user behavior by extracting features and classifying the adversary in the network. But, due to IoT device's constrained nature in computation and storage facilities, DL cannot be administered on those. In this paper, a deep intelligent DDoS attack detection scheme (DI-ADS) is proposed for fog-based IoT applications. The framework mainly uses a deep learning model (DLM) to detect DDoS attacks in the network. The DLM is installed on the computation module of the fog node that predicts the end IoT device behavior. For the selection of the best DLM model at the fog layer, the performance comparison is made on Deep Neural Multilayer Perceptron (DNMLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models along with the conventional machine learning (ML) models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). e simulation is performed using the Python Anaconda platform by considering a new DDoS-SDN (Mendeley Dataset) dataset that consists of three DDoS attacks such as TCP Syn, UDP Flood, and ICMP attacks. From the results, DNMLP showed the best accuracy of 99.44\% as compared to other DL and ML models. By outperforming nature in the detection of DDoS attacks, DNMLP is considered in the proposed framework for being implemented at the fog layer.},

	abstract = {The cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) have become two key technologies to meet future business requirements. However, a massive scale of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) has been widely applied to congest network critical links and to paralyze the cloud and IoT service. This is mainly due to DDoS is easily implemented, obfuscated, and occulted by launching large-scale legitimate low-speed flows and rolling target links to paralyze target network areas. Many metrics and risk access management frameworks to evaluate the impact of DDoS are proposed. However, they all lack time granularity to evaluate the cost of different scales of attacks in IoT or large-scale network structure. This study proposes an AI Driven Evaluation framework, called ADE, that applies Convolution Neural Networks to statistically evaluate the network status through end-to-end functionality (Input: network status; Output: DDoS detected or not) without any manual intervention. ADE provides quantitative security risk analysis by using learning time as the control variable, network structure as the independent variable, and time to identify DDoS as the dependent variable. The learning time to detect DDoS event and recover the system is then applied to evaluate the scale of this DDoS, the reasonability of the regulated RTO, and the vulnerability of the current net-work topology and the improvement due to the new security solution. The experiment results demonstrate the contributions of ADEare (1) providing objective and quantitative analytical security risk assessment indicator, (2) providing an autonomic DDoS defense framework without any manual intervention which allows cloud computing and Internet of Things company focuses on their service and leaves security defending to ADE, and (3) demonstrating the possibility of AI assisted risk assessment which enables security defense solution buyer with less security domain experts to evaluate suitable network defense strategy.},

	abstract = {DDoS attacks often happen in cloud servers and cause a devastating problem. However, an increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes us not ignore the influence of large-scale DDoS attacks from IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based on a multi-layer IoT DDoS attack detection system, including IoT devices, IoT gateways, SDN switches, and cloud servers. Firstly, we build eight smart poles with various sensors on our campus and collect sensor data as our datasets through wireless networks or wired networks. Next, we extract the features based on DDoS attack types. The feature selection can result in high accuracy DDoS attack detection in the real IoT environment. The experimental results show that our multi-layer DDoS detection system can accurately detect DDoS attacks. And the SDN controller can block venomous devices effectively according to blacklists from the results of our IoT DDoS attacks detection system.},

	abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) network is growing big owing to its utility in smart applications. An IoT network is susceptible to security breaches, in majority due to the resource-constrained nature of IoT. Of the various breaches, the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack can snip off the network service to the users in various ways, such as consumption of server's resources, saturating link bandwidth, etc. These types of DDoS breaches can turn out to be a catastrophe in critical IoT use cases. This article delves into tackling the DDoS attack triggered by malicious wireless IoT on IoT servers. Our security scheme leverages the cloud and software-defined network (SDN) paradigm to mitigate the DDoS attack on IoT servers. We have proposed a novel mechanism named learning-driven detection mitigation (LEDEM) that detects DDoS using a semisupervised machine-learning algorithm and mitigates DDoS. We tested LEDEM in the testbed and emulated topology, and compared the results with state-of-the-art solutions. We achieved an improved accuracy rate of 96.28\% in detecting DDoS attack.},

	journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
	year = {2022},
	volume = {118},
	month = {July},
	abstract = {The data is exposed to many attacks during communication in the network environment. It is becoming increasingly essential to identify intrusions into network communications. Researchers use machine learning techniques to design effective intrusion detection systems. In this study, we proposed an intrusion detection system that includes preprocessing procedures and a deep learning model to detect DDoS attacks. For this purpose, various models based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) have been evaluated in terms of detection performance and real-time performance. We tested the suggested model using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, which is frequently used in the literature. We applied preprocess techniques such as feature elimination, random subset selection, feature selection, duplication removal, and normalization to the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. As a result, better recognition performance was obtained for the training and testing evaluations. According to the test results, 99.99\% for binary and 99.30\% for multiclass accuracy using the CNN-based inception like model gave the best results among the proposed models. Also, the inference time of the proposed model for various sizes of test data looks promising compared to baseline models with a smaller number of trainable parameters. The proposed IDS system, together with the preprocessing methods, provides better results when compared to state-of-the-art studies. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the advent of cloud computing has transformed the field of computing and information technology. It has been enabling customers to rent virtual resources and take advantage of various on-demand services with the lowest costs. Despite the advantages of cloud computing, it faces several threats; an example is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is considered among the most serious. This article presents real-time monitoring and detection of DDoS attacks on the cloud using a machine learning approach. Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and random forest machine learning classifiers have been selected to build a predictive model named ``Real-Time DDoS flood Attack Monitoring and Detection RT-AMD.{''} The DDoS-2020 dataset was constructed with 70,020 records to evaluate RT-AMD's accuracy. The DDoS-2020 contains three protocols for network/transport-level, which are TCP, DNS, and ICMP. This article evaluates the proposed model by comparing its accuracy with related works. Our model has shown improvement in the results and reached real-time attack detection using incremental learning. The model achieved 99.38\% accuracy for the random forest in real-time on the cloud environment and 99.39\% on local testing. The RT-AMD was evaluated on the NSL-KDD dataset as well, in which it achieved 99.30\% accuracy in real-time in a cloud environment.},

	abstract = {To enhance dependable resource allocation against increasing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, in this article, we investigate interactions between a sensor deviceedgeVM pair and a DDoS attacker using a game-theoretic framework, under the constraints of the task time, resource budget, and incomplete knowledge of the processing time of machine learning tasks. In this game, the sensor device expects an edgeVM to cooperate and choose its resource allocation strategy with the objective of satisfying the minimum resource required of machine learning tasks at the corresponding sensor device. Similarly, the attacker's objective is to strategically allocate resources so that the resource constraint of the machine learning tasks is not satisfied. Owing to a lack of complete information of the processing time of the machine learning tasks, this strategic resource allocation problem between the two players is modeled as a Bayesian Q-learning game, in which the optimal strategies of the sensor device-edgeVM pair and the attacker are analyzed. Furthermore, probability distributions are employed by the corresponding players to model the incomplete nature of the game and a greedy Q-learning algorithm is proposed to dependable resource allocation against DDoS attacks. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is superior to other dependable resource allocation mechanisms under incomplete information for DDoS attacks in the sensor edge cloud.},

	abstract = {One of the major security challenges in cloud computing is distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In these attacks, multiple nodes are used to attack the cloud by sending huge traffic. This results in the unavailability of cloud services to legitimate users. In this research paper, a hybrid machine learning-based technique has been proposed to detect these attacks. The proposed technique is implemented by combining the extreme learning machine (ELM) model and the blackhole optimization algorithm. Various experiments have been performed with the help of four benchmark datasets namely, NSL KDD, ISCX IDS 2012, CICIDS2017, and CICDDoS2019, to evaluate the performance of our proposed technique. It achieves an accuracy of 99.23\%, 92.19\%, 99.50\%, 99.80\% with NSL KDD, ISCX IDS 2012, CICIDS2017, and CICDDoS2019, respectively. The performance comparison with other techniques based on ELM, artificial neural network (ANN) trained with blackhole optimization, backpropagation ANN, and other state-of-the-art techniques is also performed.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has gained significant popularity due to its reliability and scalability, making it a compelling area of research. However, this technology is not without its challenges, including network connectivity dependencies, downtime, vendor lock-in, limited control, and most importantly, its vulnerability to attacks. Therefore, guarding the cloud is the objective of this paper, which focuses, in a novel approach, on two prevalent cloud attacks: Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and Man-in-the-Cloud (MitC) computing attacks. To tackle the detection of these malicious activities, machine learning algorithms, namely Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), are utilized. Experimental simulations of DDoS and MitC attacks are conducted within a cloud environment, and the resultant data is compiled into a dataset for training and evaluating the machine learning algorithms. The study reveals the effectiveness of these algorithms in accurately identifying and classifying malicious activities, effectively distinguishing them from legitimate network traffic. The finding highlights Decision Trees algorithm with most promising potential of guarding the cloud and mitigating the impact of various cyber threats.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a serious security threat to cloud computing that affects the availability of cloud services. Therefore, defending against these attacks becomes imperative. In this paper, we present a DDoS attack detection system based on an improved Self-adaptive evolutionary extreme learning machine (SaE-ELM). SaE-ELM model is improved by incorporating two more features. Firstly, it can adapt the best suitable crossover operator. Secondly, it can automatically determine the appropriate number of hidden layer neurons. These features improve the learning and classification capabilities of the model. The proposed system is evaluated using four datasets namely, NSL-KDD, ISCX IDS 2012, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS 2017. It achieves the detection accuracy of 86.80\%, 98.90\%, 89.17\%, and 99.99\% with NSL-KDD, ISCX IDS 2012, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS 2017 datasets, respectively. The experiments show that the performance of the proposed attack detection system is better than the system based on original SaE-ELM and state-of-the-art techniques. However, it shows a longer training time than SaE-ELM based system. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing services provide a wide range of resource pool for maintaining a large amount of data. Cloud services are commonly used as the private or public data forum based on the demand, and the increase in usage has lead to security concerns. The information in the cloud comes under threat due to hackers, and the most common attack on the cloud data is considered as the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. This work has concentrated on detecting the DDoS attack by developing the deep learning-based classifier. The service request from the users is collected and grouped as the log information. From the log file, some important features are selected for the classification using the Bhattacharya distance measure to reduce the training time of the classifier. Here, Taylor-Elephant Herd Optimisation based Deep Belief Network (TEHO-DBN), is developed by modifying the Elephant Herd Optimisation (EHO) with the Taylor series and the algorithm thus developed is adopted to train the Deep Belief Network (DBN) for the DDoS attack detection. From the simulation results, it can be concluded that the proposed TEHO based DBN classifier has improved performance with a maximum accuracy of 0.830.},

	abstract = {A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack represents a major threat to service providers. More specifically, a DDoS attack aims to disrupt and deny services to legitimate users by overwhelming the target with a massive number of malicious requests. A cyberattack of this kind is likely to result in tremendous economic losses for businesses and service providers due to increasing both operating and financial costs. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used to prevent DDoS attacks. Indeed, many defense systems have been transformed into smart and intelligent systems through the use of ML techniques, which allow them to defeat DDoS attacks. This paper analyzes recent studies concerning DDoS detection methods that have adapted single and hybrid ML approaches in modern networking environments. Additionally, the paper discusses different DDoS defense systems based on ML techniques that make use of a virtualized environment, including cloud computing, software-defined network, and network functions virtualization environments. As the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been the subject of significant research attention in recent years, the paper also discusses ML approaches as security solutions against DDoS attacks in IoT environments. Furthermore, the paper recommends a number of directions for future research. This paper is intended to assist the research community with the design and development of effective defense systems capable of overcoming different types of DDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {Cyberattacks against the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) will continue to evolve as the industry continues to adopt new and advanced connected technologies. These advances should result in a complex ecosystem that integrates different technologies (5G, 6G, Cloud, IoT, etc.) and presents a large attack surface. Denial of service (DoS) attacks are among the most dangerous attacks against connected vehicles, where an attacker overwhelm the network with random generated messages. An effective detection of the occurrence of such attacks is a key step for any defense scheme. Machine-Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have attracted a lot of attention in the literature for DoS detection. However, there is no comprehensive comparative analysis of their efficiency in the IoV context. In this paper, we study the detection performance of several classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and K-nearest neighbors to differentiate normal CAM messages from flooding CAM ones launched by the vehicular bot in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) environment. The obtained results demonstrate that XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM algorithms have a very high detection precision.},

	abstract = {In recent years, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to network security. How to detect and defend against DDoS attacks is currently a hot topic in both industry and academia. There have been a lot of methodologies and tools devised to detect DDoS attacks and reduce the damage they cause. Still, most of the methods cannot simultaneously achieve efficient detection with a small number of false alarms. In this case, deep learning techniques are appropriate and effective algorithm to categorize both normal and attacked information. Hence, a novel a feature selection-whale optimization algorithm-deep neural network (FS-WOA-DNN) method is proposed in this research article to mitigate DDoS attack in effective manner. Initially, pre-processing step is carried out for the input dataset where min-max normalization technique is applied to replace all the input in a specified range. Later on, that normalized information is fed into the proposed FS-WOA to select the optimal set of features for ease the classification process. Those selected features are subjected to deep neural network classifier to categorize normal and attacked data. Further to enhance the security of proposed model, the normal data are secure with the help of homomorphic encryption and are securely stored in the cloud. The proposed algorithm will be simulated using the MATLAB tool and tested experimentally that shows 95.35\% accuracy in detecting DDoS attack.},

	abstract = {While Digital Twins (DTs) bring convenience to city managers, they also generate new challenges to city network security. Currently, cyberspace security becomes increasingly complicated. Intrusion detection and Deep Learning (DL) are combined with shunning security threats in service computing systems and improving network defense capabilities. DTs can be applied to network security. People's understanding of cyberspace security can be improved using DTs to digitally define, model, and display the network environment and security status. The intrusion detection data are optimized based on DL technology, and a network intrusion detection algorithm integrated with Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is proposed. In the cloud service system, a trust model based on Keyed-Hashing-based Self-Synchronization (KHSS) is introduced. This model predicts the security state and detects attacks according to existing malicious attacks, ensuring the network security defense system's regular operation. Finally, simulation experiments verify the Deep Belief Networks (DBN) model's feasibility and the cloud trust model. The DBN algorithm proposed improves the correct detection rate of unknown samples by 4.05\% compared with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. From the 20,100 pieces of data in the test dataset, the number of correct attacks detected by the DBN algorithm exceeds those by the SVM algorithm by 818. DBN algorithm requires a short detection time while ensuring optimal detection accuracy. The KHSS+DBN model predicts cloud security states, and the results are the same as the actual states, with an error of only 1\%similar to 2\%.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing facilitates the users with on-demand services over the Internet. The services are accessible from anywhere at any time. Despite the valuable services, the paradigm is, also, prone to security issues. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack affects the availability of cloud services and causes security threats to cloud computing. Detection of DDoS attacks is necessary for the availability of services for legitimate users. The topic has been studied by many researchers, with better accuracy for different datasets. This article presents a method for DDoS attack detection in cloud computing. The primary objective of this article is to reduce misclassification error in DDoS detection. In the proposed work, we select the most relevant features, by applying two feature selection techniques, i.e., the Mutual Information (MI) and Random Forest Feature Importance (RFFI) methods. Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Weighted Voting Ensemble (WVE), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Logistic Regression (LR) are applied to selected features. The experimental results show that the accuracy of RF, GB, WVE, and KNN with 19 features is 0.99. To further study these methods, misclassifications of the methods are analyzed, which lead to more accurate measurements. Extensive experiments conclude that the RF performed well in DDoS attack detection and misclassified only one attack as normal. Comparative results are presented to validate the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing offers a broad range of resource pools for conserving a huge quantity of information. Due to the intrusion of attackers, the information that exists in the cloud is threatened. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is the main reason for attacks in the cloud. In this study, a Fractional Anti Corona Virus Optimization-based Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Network (FACVO-based DNFN) is devised for detecting DDoS in the cloud. The production of log files, feature fusion, data augmentation, and DDoS attack detection is the processing stages involved in this phase of the DDoS attack detection process. The feature fusion is carried out by RV coefficient and Deep Quantum Neural Network (Deep QNN), and the data augmentation is performed. Then, the Anti Corona Virus Optimization (ACVO) method and Fractional Calculus (FC) are both incorporated to create the FACVO algorithm. The DNFN is trained by the created FACVO algorithm, which identifies the DDoS attack. The proposed approach achieved testing accuracy, TPR, TNR, and precision values of 0.9304, 0.9088, 0.9293, and 0.8745 for using the NSL-KDD dataset without attack, and 0.9200, 0.8991, 0.9015, and 0.8648 for using the BoT-IoT dataset without attack.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) platform allows physical devices to connect directly to the internet and upload data continuously. Insecure access makes IoT platforms vulnerable to different network intrusion attacks. As a result, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a core component of a modern IoT platform. However, traditional IDS often follows rule-based detection where the rules can be changed and exposed to the attacker and becomes weak over time. An efficient IDS also needs to be dynamic and effective in real time. This paper proposes a deep learning-based algorithm to protect the network against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, insecure data flow, and similar network intrusions. A system architecture is designed for a cloud-based IoT framework to implement the proposed algorithm efficiently. The performance evaluation using standard datasets demonstrates that the proposed model provides an accuracy of up to 99.99\%.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IOT) is a general term for all interconnected devices as well as the technology that enables object-to- object and cloud-to-object communication.However, there are several regular and dangerous threats to the development of this technology.The Distributed DoS (DDOS) attacks are extremelyinnovative and complex, making them almost inevitable to detect by the existing technology or detection system. Due to their complexity and difficulty, novel types of DDoS attacks are practically impossible for intrusion detection systems to detect or mitigate.Effective DDoS traffic detection is made feasible by Machine Learning (ML) technologies. In this paper, the popular ML methods were tested on the CICDoS2019 dataset to determine the most effective one for DDoS detection. A hybrid MLDDoS detection approach using estimator functions is also proposed.The framework for multi-classifying different DDoS attack types can be improved in future research, and a hybrid algorithm can be tested using updated datasets for DDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {The popularity and usage of Cloud computing is increasing rapidly. Several companies are investing in this field either for their own use or to provide it as a service for others. One of the results of Cloud development is the emergence of various security problems for both industry and consumer. One of the ways to secure Cloud is by using Machine Learning (ML). ML techniques have been used in various ways to prevent or detect attacks and security gaps on the Cloud. In this paper, we provide a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of ML and Cloud security methodologies and techniques. We analyzed 63 relevant studies and the results of the SLR are categorized into three main research areas: (i) the different types of Cloud security threats, (ii) ML techniques used, and (iii) the performance outcomes. We have defined 11 Cloud security areas. Moreover, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and data privacy are the most common Cloud security areas, with a 16\% level of use and 14\%respectively. On the other hand, we found 30 ML techniques used, some used hybrid and others as standalone. The most popular ML used is SVM in both hybrid and standalone models. Furthermore, 60\% of the papers compared their models with other models to prove the efficiency of their proposed model. Moreover, 13 different evaluation metrics were enumerated. The most applied metric is true positive rate and least used is training time. Lastly, from 20 datasets found, KDD and KDD CUP'99 are the most used among relevant studies.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to internet and cloud security. Our study utilizes a Poisson distribution model to efficiently detect DDoS attacks with a computational complexity of O(n). Unlike Machine Learning (ML)-based algorithms, our method only needs to set up one or more Poisson models for legitimate traffic based on the granularity of the time periods during preprocessing, thus eliminating the need for training time. We validate this approach with four virtual machines on the CDX 3.0 platform, each simulating different aspects of DDoS attacks for offensive, monitoring, and defense evaluation purposes. The study further analyzes seven diverse DDoS attack methods. When compared with existing methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance, highlighting its potential effectiveness in real-world DDoS attack detection.},

	abstract = {Edge-driven software applications often deployed as online services in the cloud-to-edge continuum lack significant protection for services and infrastructures against emerging cyberattacks. Very-Short Intermittent Distributed Denial of Service (VSI-DDoS) attack is one of the biggest factors for diminishing the Quality of Services (QoS) and Quality of Experiences (QoE) for users on edge. Unlike conventional DDoS attacks, these attacks live for a very short time (on the order of a few milliseconds) in the traffic to deceive users with a legitimate service experience. To provide protection, we propose a novel and efficient approach for detecting VSI-DDoS attacks using reinforced transformer learning that mitigates the tail latency and service availability problems in edge clouds. In the presence of attacks, the users' demand for availing ultra-low latency and high throughput services deployed on the edge, can never be met. Moreover, these attacks send very-short intermittent requests towards the target services that enforce longer delays in users' responses. The assimilation of transformer with deep reinforcement learning accelerates detection performance under adverse conditions by adapting the dynamic and the most discernible patterns of attacks (e.g., multiplicative temporal dependency, attack dynamism). The extensive experiments with testbed and benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is suitable, effective, and efficient for detecting VSI-DDoS attacks in edge clouds. The results outperform state-of-the-art methods with 0.9\% - 3.2\% higher accuracy in both datasets.},

	abstract = {The key advantage of the cloud is that it fluidly propagates to fulfil changeable requirements and provides an environment that is repeatable and can be scaled down instantly when needed. Therefore, it is necessary to protect this cloud environment from malicious attacks such as spamming, Service (DDoS). Among these kinds of attacks, DDoS has the capability to establish a high flood of malicious attacks on the cloud environment or Software Defined Networking (SDN) based cloud environment. Hence in this work, an ensemble based deep learning technique is proposed to detect attacks in cloud and SDN based cloud environments. Here, the ensemble model is formed by combining K-means with deep learning classifiers such as Long Short term Memory (LSTM) network, Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Initially, preprocessing with data cleaning and standardization is applied to the input data. Meanwhile, a random forest is implemented for extracting the minimum significant features. After that, the proposed ensemble based approach is utilized for detecting the intrusion. This approach is used to enhance the performance of the deep learning classifiers without much computational complexity. This model is trained and evaluated using two datasets as CICIDS 2018 and SDN based DDOS attack datasets. The proposed approach provides better intrusion detection performance in terms of F1 measure, precision, accuracy, and recall. By using the proposed approach, the accuracy and precision value attained is 99.685 and 0.992, respectively.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a major threat to the Internet of Things (IoT), Software Defined Networks (SDN), and Cloud Computing Networks. Due to the tremendous applications of IoT networks, the number of DDoS attacks is increasing significantly, and most sophisticated DDoS attacks are generated through IoT botnets. An IoT botnet-based DDoS attack can disrupt the network quickly with a surge of malicious traffic. Especially in an SDN network, it is important to detect the DDoS attack before it occurs to the SDN controller. DDoS attacks on the centralized controller of the SDN can disrupt the whole network. So, identifying DDoS attacks at the earliest is a critical security measure for network experts and practitioners. In this paper, we analyze the DDoS attack on an SDN environment and develop a method to identify the DDoS attack using Deep Learning (DL). The proposed method converts the captured raw network traffic to image data and classifies the malicious data from normal data. The method is evaluated on our test-bed simulated dataset and two other benchmark datasets. The experimental comparison shows that the proposed method performs better on all three datasets, giving more than 99\% classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {Web application services and networks become a major target of low-rate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks such as Very Short Intermittent DDoS (VSI-DDoS). These threats exploit the TCP congestion control mechanism to cause transient resource outage and impute delays for legitimate users' requests, while they bypass the secure systems. Besides that, cross-layer VSI-DDoS attacks, where the performed attacks are towards the different layers of the edge cloud infrastructures, are able to cause violation of customers' Service-Level Agreements (SLAB) with less visible behavioral patterns. In this work, we propose a novel Deep Ensemble Learning Approach named DELA for detection of cross-layer VSI-DDoS on the edge cloud. This approach is developed based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), ensemble learning, and a new voting mechanism based on Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN). In addition, it employs a novel training and detection algorithm to combat such attacks in web services and networks. The model shows improved results due to the utilization of historical information in decision-making and also the usage of neural network as aggregator instead of a static threshold-based aggregation. Moreover, we propose a novel overlapped data chunking algorithm that is able to ameliorate the detection performance. Furthermore, the evaluation of DELA shows its superior performance over our testbed and benchmark datasets. Accordingly, DELA achieves on average 4.88\% higher F1 score compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {The reliability of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices is heavily dependent on the security model employed to protect user data and prevent devices from engaging in malicious activity. Existing approaches for detecting phishing, distributed denial of service (DDoS), and Botnet attacks often focus on either the device or the backend. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based distributed deep learning framework for phishing and Botnet attack detection and mitigation. The model comprises two key security mechanisms working cooperatively, namely: (1) a Distributed Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model embedded as an IoT device micro-security addon for detecting phishing and application layer DDoS attacks; and (2) a cloud-based temporal Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network model hosted on the back-end for detecting Botnet attacks, and ingest CNN embeddings to detect distributed phishing attacks across multiple IoT devices. The distributed CNN model, embedded into a ML engine in the client's IoT device, allows us to detect and defend the IoT device from phishing attacks at the point of origin. We create a dataset consisting of both phishing and non-phishing URIs to train the proposed CNN add-on security model, and select the N\_BaIoT dataset for training the back-end LSTM model. The joint training method minimizes communication and resource requirements for attack detection, and maximizes the usefulness of extracted features. In addition, an aggregation of schemes allows the automatic fusion of multiple requests to improve the overall performance of the system. Our experiments show that the IoT micro-security add-on running the proposed CNN model is capable of detecting phishing attacks with an accuracy of 94.3\% and a F-1 score of 93.58\%. Using the back-end LSTM model, the model detects Botnet attacks with an accuracy of 94.80\% using all malicious data points in the used dataset Thus, the findings demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting attacks, both at device and at the back-end level, in a distributed fashion.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is one of the most tempting technologies in today's computing scenario as it provides a cost-efficient solutions by reducing the large upfront cost for buying hardware infrastructures and computing power. Fog computing is an added support to cloud environment by leveraging with doing some of the less compute intensive task to be done at the edge devices, which reduces the response time for end user computing. But the vulnerabilities to these systems are still a big concern. Among several security needs, availability is one that makes the demanded services available to the targeted customers all the time. Availability is often challenged by external attacks like Denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS). This paper demonstrates a novel source-based DDoS mitigating schemes that could be employed in both fog and cloud computing scenarios to eliminate these attacks. It deploys the DDoS defender module which works on a machine learning-based light detection method, present at the SDN controller. This scheme uses the network traffic data to analyze, predict, and filter incoming data, so that it can send the filtered legitimate packets to the server and blocking the rest.},

	abstract = {Cloud-native computing is getting more and more popular in recent years where containerized microservices architectural designs play a central role in building a distributed systems and services. On one hand, they bring convenience and simplicity to build massively scalable distributed cloud-native applications and enable continuous development and delivery for their services. On the other hand, they widen the surface of malicious intrusions, which, in turn, without proper defense mechanisms, lessens their benefits to a certain degree. Among the biggest threats of malicious intrusions are those that belong to the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) family. Such type of attacks are challenging because DDoS attacks are elevated hard-to-absorbed threats and have a high degree of variability in types, design, and complexity. In this work, resilient backpropagation neural network was used to build an intelligent network intrusion detection model against the most modernistic DDoS attacks in the cloud-native computing environment. We evaluated our proposed model using the benchmarking Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity evaluation CICDDoS 2019 dataset. Our proposed detection model has achieved high reflective DDoS attack detection. Therefore, it is appropriate to defend against reflective DDoS attacks in containerized cloud-native platforms. Experimental results indicate that the DDoS attack detection accuracy of the proposed resilient neural network model is as high as 97.07\% which outperforms most of the well-known learning models mentioned in the most related work. Moreover, the proposed model has achieved a competitive run time performance that highly meets the delay requirements of containerized cloud computing.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing offers comfortable service to business sectors as they can concentrate on their products. Over the internet, cloud computing is liable to various security threats and attacks which is a primary obstacle to the growth of cloud computing services. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is one such attack that exploits cloud computing services using compromised machines; hence, its detection is a significant field of research. Several DDoS detection schemes have been proposed in the past, but they fail to detect real-time active DDoS attacks because of their growth in severity and volume. Machine learning (ML) techniques are efficient in making predictions; hence, in this study, a hybrid ML intrusion detection system (IDS) model is proposed. The performance of the proposed IDS model is improved by employing a 10-fold cross-validation technique to perform feature selection, reducing data dimensions on the publicly available benchmark NSL-KDD dataset. Performance validation of the proposed hybrid IDS model is done using the confusion matrix. Support vector machine (SVM) parameters are fine-tuned using hybrid Harris Hawks optimization (HHO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. The performance of these hybrid algorithms is compared with other classical algorithms such as C4.5, K-nearest neighbor, and SVM using performance metrics such as precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy. From these comparisons, it can be inferred that the proposed SVM with hybrid optimization HHO-PSO machine learning IDS model performs better DDoS detection with good performance metric values.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service attacks are common and very severe threat to various computing technology like Cloud, IoT and Blockchain because of the disruption they cause to the services that are provided. Many different types of DDoS attacks are there, each with a unique action, making it difficult for network monitoring and control systems to identify and prevent them. The objective of this research work is to explore and select a set of data to represent DDoS attack events and attack traffic information. A pre-processing phase is used to clean and transform the data, and afterwards the generation of a model of machine learning for multi-class classification is done. This is carried out to identify the various classification of different types of DDoS attacks. We have used CIC dataset for the experiment which contains all types of DDoS attack and huge in number of records. Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and AdaBoost are six different types of machine learning algorithms employed in this research. FRom the results, AdaBoost achieves the best accuracy of 99.87\% in 27.4 s of computation time. Naive Bayes has the fastest computing time (3.2 s) with 94.15\% accuracy, where as Support Vector Machine has the slowest time, a lazy learner (229m26s for training and 0.2 s for prediction) and has the low accuracy (95.73\%).},

	abstract = {Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in the cloud Computing (CC) environment has received paramount interest over the last few years. Among the latest approaches, Deep Learning (DL)-based IDS methods allow the discovery of attacks with the highest performance. In the CC environment, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are widespread. The cloud services will be rendered unavailable to legitimate end-users as a consequence of the overwhelming network traffic, resulting in financial losses. Although various researchers have proposed many detection techniques, there are possible obstacles in terms of detection performance due to the use of insignificant traffic features. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid deep learning mode based on hybridizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with LongShort-Term Memory (LSTM) is used due to its robustness and efficiency in detecting normal and attack traffic. Besides, the ensemble feature selection, mutualization aggregation between Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (PSO), Krill Hird (KH), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), is used to select the most important features that would influence the detection performance in detecting DDoS attack in CC. A benchmark dataset proposed by the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity (CIC), called CICIDS 2017 is used to evaluate the proposed IDS. The results revealed that the proposed IDS outperforms the state-of-the-art IDSs, as it achieved 97.9\%, 98.3\%, 97.9\%, 98.1\%, respectively. As a result, the proposed IDS achieves the requirements of getting high security, automatic, efficient, and self-decision detection of DDoS attacks.},

Various research on distributed IDS s have been proposed to detect DDoS however, the limitations of these works the lack of technique to determine an appropriate period to share attack information among nodes in the distributed IDS. Therefore, this article proposes a distributed IDS that uses a binary segmentation change point detection algorithm to address the appropriate period to send attack information to nodes in distributed IDS and using parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent with Support Vector Machine (SGD-SVM) to achieve the distributed detection. The result of the proposed scheme was implemented in Apache Spark using NSL-KDD benchmark intrusion detection dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed distributed intrusion detection scheme outperforms existing distributed IDS for cloud computing.},

	abstract = {The advent of crucial areas such as smart healthcare and autonomous transportation, bring in new requirements on the computing infrastructure, including higher demand for real-time processing capability with minimized latency and maximized availability. The traditional cloud infrastructure has several deficiencies when meeting such requirements due to its centralization. Edge clouds seems to be the solution for the aforementioned requirements, in which the resources are much closer to the edge devices and provides local computing power and high Quality of Service (QoS). However, there are still security issues that endanger the functionality of edge clouds. One of the recent types of such issues is Very Short Intermittent Distributed Denial of Service (VSI-DDoS) which is a new category of low-rate DDoS attacks that targets both small and large-scale web services. This attack generates very short bursts of HTTP request intermittently towards target services to encounter unexpected degradation of QoS at edge clouds. In this paper, we formulate the problem with a sequence modeling approach to address short intermittent intervals of DDoS attacks during the rendering of services on edge clouds using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with local attention. The proposed approach ameliorates the detection performance by learning from the most important discernible patterns of the sequence data rather than considering complete historical information and hence achieves a more sophisticated model approximation. Experimental results confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach for VSI-DDoS detection on edge clouds and it achieves 2\% more accuracy when compared with baseline methods.},

	abstract = {Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a way to manage networks that separate the control plane from the forwarding plane {[}1]. The cloud provides a powerful computing platform that enables individuals and organizations to perform different tasks on the internet. Nowadays, many types of attacks compromise SDN in a Cloud computing platform. Out of these attacks, this research will focus on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) in IP trace. DDoS attacks can have a significant impact against single tenanted architectures {[}2]. Thus, securing such a system is not trivial, but we can maximize the security level of a computing environment. This paper proposes a newsolution approach that can be identifying, manage, and mitigate DDoS attacks. Besides, create a threat information database that will use as a reference for further investigation. Finally, the proposed solution does not consider all types of DDoS attacks and AI/Machine learning detection solutions for attack detection and mitigation.},

	abstract = {Adapting Software Defined Networking (SDN) raises many challenges including scalability and security on the Internet of Things (IoT) network. Growing network size increases resulting in the network load in the SDN controller and facing security challenges. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the most acute threats in the present scenario. The attack scenario and security of multiple controller networks are simulated and evaluated in this research. Simulation has been conducted in Mininet-SDN emulator, hosting OS was Ubuntu Linux, Wireshark was used for analysing the network traffic, support vector machines were used to classify the traffic flows. DDoS attacks were detected, and mitigation has been done using a support vector machine learning-based approach. The results show that the support vector machine's sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are excellent in the range of 98.7\% to 98.8\%. Security solutions are fast and effective in mitigating DDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing environment support resource sharing as cloud service over the internet. It enables the users to outsource data into the cloud server that can be accessed remotely from various devices distributed geographically. Accessing resources from the cloud causes various security issues as the attackers try to illegally access the data. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is one of the security concern in the cloud server. DDoS is a kind of cyber attack which disrupt normal traffic of targeted cloud server (or any other servers). In this paper, we propose an effective fuzzy and taylorelephant herd optimization (FT-EHO) inspired by deep belief network (DBN) classifier for detecting the DDoS attack. FT-EHO uses taylor series and elephant heard optimization algorithm along with a fuzzy classifier for rules learning. The performance of the proposed FT-EHO is evaluated through rigorous computer simulations. Three standard benchmark databases, namely, KDD cup, databasel and database2 are used during simulations. Four quality measures such as accuracy, detection accuracy, precision and recall are considered as a performance metrics. FT-EHO's performance is compared against the state-of-the-art methods considering the evaluation metrics. Results reveals that the proposed FT-EHO showed significantly higher value of evaluation metrics (accuracy (93.811\%), detection rate (97.200\%), precision (94.981\%) and recall (93.833\%)) as compared to other methods.

	abstract = {The rapid growth of cloud computing has led to the development of the Software-Defined Network (SDN), which is a network strategy that offers dynamic management and improved performance. However, security threats are a growing concern, particularly with the SDN controller becoming an attractive target for malicious actors and potential Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Many researchers have proposed different approaches to detecting DDoS attacks. However, those approaches suffer from high false positives, leading to low accuracy, and the main reason behind this is the use of non-qualified features and non-realistic datasets. Therefore, the deep learning (DL) algorithmic technique can be utilized to detect DDoS attacks on SDN controllers. Moreover, the proposed approach involves three stages, (1) data preprocessing, (2) cross-feature selection, which aims to identify important features for DDoS detection, and (3) detection using the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) model. A benchmark dataset is employed to evaluate the proposed approach via standard evaluation metrics, including false positive rate and detection accuracy. The findings indicate that the recommended approach effectively detects DDoS attacks with average detection accuracy, average precision, average FPR, and average F1-measure of 94.186\%, 92.146\%, 8.114\%, and 94.276\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {The fact that cloud systems are under the increasing risks of cyber attacks has made the phenomenon of information security first a need and then a necessity for these systems. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can exploit, disrupt, change, prevent or damage cloud services. Accurate and timely detection and prevention of these attacks are very important in terms of ensuring information security. During the COVID-19 period, the increase in the use of information technologies and especially the internet has made cyber attacks a real concern. Deep learning (DL) has become widely used for the purpose of detecting and preventing cyber attacks to provide information security. In this study, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based system (LSTM-CLOUD) which was designed for the detection and prevention of DDoS attacks in a public cloud network environment was proposed. The design of the system is based on a signature-based attack detection approach. The LSTM-CLOUD has two modules defined in the study: detection and defense. The function of the first module of the system was determined as detecting the occurrence of DDoS attacks with the LSTM DL model developed in this study with an accuracy rate of 99.83\% on the CICDDoS2019 data set. The function of the second module was determined as activating the defense mechanism to protect the cloud systems when attacks are detected. The comparison results showed that our LSTM model had a performance as good as those in the previous studies conducted with different DL algorithms on the same and different datasets. The results obtained show the effectiveness of the LSTM model developed in this study in detecting the occurrence of attacks. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks aim to exploit the capacity and performance of a network's infrastructure, making the cloud environment one of the biggest targets for attackers. Many efforts are being made in the field of technology to prevent them from disrupting the services provided. Machine Learning techniques are a means to protect against DDOS attacks. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and classifiers are the main components of any prevention framework. The focus of this study is to find and enhance the feature selection approach for increasing the accuracy of the classifiers in detecting DDOS attacks from regular traffic. We used four different techniques, including Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), Random Forest Feature Importance (RFFI), Mutual information (MI), and Chi-squared(X2) measure which we tested on different classifiers. The first selection approach was based on the feature's independency level then the second iteration was based on the feature's importance. We also examined the claim of dropping attacks from the dataset for better accuracy. The best performing set of features was from using PCC and RFFI together for feature selection with average accuracy and precision of 99.27\% and 97.60\%, which is higher than the use of PCC for both measures by almost 2\%. The accuracy is also higher by nearly 12\% from the same approach dropping 50\% of the attacks.},

	abstract = {The explosive growth of end devices that generate massive amounts of data requires close-proximity computing resources for processing at the network's edge. Having geographic distributions and limited resources of edge nodes or servers opens several doors for attackers to exploit them primarily to the detriment of deployed services; one of the recent attacks is Very Short Intermittent Distributed Denial of Services (VSI-DDoS). Deep learning-based models have been developed to detect and mitigate such attacks but cause the degrading quality of models due to covariate shifts when deployed in real-world environments. Therefore, we propose a new approach, called MetaVSID, to detect VSI-DDoS attacks in edge clouds using meta-reinforcement learning followed by ensemble learning to increase the robustness of the model in detecting VSI-DDoS attacks early. The proposed model can capture dynamic patterns of VSI-DDoS attacks, from which it identifies manipulated services and increase service availability when covariate shifts at deployment time. We carry out extensive experiments to validate the MetaVSID using both testbed and benchmark datasets. Via the meta-reinforced downsampling process, the proposed method improves sample efficiency, leading to cost-effective policies. Moreover, the optimized policies are generalized to adapt to dynamic changes in the training distribution. Our experimental results demonstrate that MetaVSID stably achieves better performance in multiple evaluation settings with the difference from baseline models from 1.5\% to 7.5\% in terms of AUC for both VSI-DDoS and DDoS detection, especially under covariate shift settings.},

While it provides a flexible network infrastructure, it also faces security threats, particularly from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks due to its centralized design. This survey comprehensively reviews the efforts of various researchers in safeguarding SDN against DDoS attacks and analyzes different detection and mitigation strategies employed in SDN environments. Furthermore, the survey explores various types of DDoS attacks that can occur across different planes and communication links in SDN. Additionally, emerging security measures for preventing DDoS attacks in SDN are examined. The survey also reviews the datasets, tools, and simulators used for detecting DDoS attacks in SDN. Moreover, the survey identifies various open challenges in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks in SDN and outlines potential future research directions. Lastly, the survey provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of various DDoS detection techniques based on various essential parameters.},

	abstract = {At present, cyber-attacks are steadily increasing in the cloud network. TCP, ICMP, UDP protocol-based Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are the major contributors for making the cloud-based system unsafe. The rate of growth of DDoS cyber-attack is a severe and challenging problem in the network. In the literature, to handle such attacks, various feature selection, and classification techniques are used. In these methods, for the collection of optimal attributes, static thresholding methods are applied. However, when the various variant of DDoS causes a DDoS attack, the size of packets and attribute's value is significantly changed. Thus, the methods utilizing static statistics are not suitable for a dynamic network. Therefore, an adaptive threshold-based Mean Absolute Deviation technique (MAD) is used to overcome these drawbacks. Moreover, in this work, the Stacked Ensemble (SE) approach is utilized instead of the single classification algorithm for the classification purpose. The proposed approach comprises of three components; (1) data pre-processing, (2) optimal attribute selection, and (3) detection and prevention system from DDoS attacks. In this work, to evaluate the proposed approach, a standard NSL-KDD dataset is used. It is observed that MAD with SE beats all other combinations. In conventional methods, selecting a single classifier may not perform well because it works well on training data, but it poorly classifies the non-viewed new data. The stack ensemble approach removes this issue. Moreover TCP, UDP, and ICMP-based DDoS flooding attacks can also be easily noticed and classified by MAD -SE.},

The attack aim is a menace to network security and exhausting the target networks with malicious traffic from multiple sites. Although a plethora of conventional methods have been proposed to detect DDoS attacks, so far the rapid diagnosis of these attacks using feature selection algorithms is a daunting challenge. The proposed system uses a hybrid methodology for selecting features by applying feature selection methods on machine learning classifiers. Feature selections methods, namely chi-square, Extra Tree and ANOVA have been applied on four classifiers Random Forest, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors and XGBoost for early detection of DDoS attacks on IoT devices. We use the CICDDoS2019 dataset containing comprehensive DDoS attacks to train and assess the proposed methodology in a cloud-based environment (Google Colab). Based on the experimental results, the proposed hybrid methodology provides superior performance with a feature reduction ratio of 82.5\% by achieving 98.34\% accuracy with ANOVA for XGBoost and helps in early detection of DDoS attacks on IoT devices.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a subclass of denial of service attack that performs severe attack in a cloud computing environment. It makes a malicious attempt to disturb the usual services of any network or server by using botnets. Hence, an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to detect this attack. Some limitations in the existing IDS models for DDoS attack detection are delayed convergence, local stagnation issues, and local and global optimal trapping issues. These limitations are met by the recurrent neural network (RNN) and deep learning- (DL-) based proposed models that can utilize the previous states of the hidden neuron. The proposed research has used a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and autoencoder- and decoder-based deep learning strategy with gradient descent learning rule. The network parameters like weight vectors and bias coefficient are tuned optimally by employing the proposed a hybrid Harris Hawks optimization (HHO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The proposed hybrid optimization algorithm selects the essential attributes, and the results obtained confirmed that the proposed LSTM and deep learning model outperformed all other models developed in the literature.},

	abstract = {Internet usage has grown exponentially, with individuals and companies performing multiple daily transactions in cyberspace rather than in the real world. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated this process. As a result of the widespread usage of the digital environment, traditional crimes have also shifted to the digital space. Emerging technologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, wireless communication, and cryptocurrencies are raising security concerns in cyberspace. Recently, cyber criminals have started to use cyber attacks as a service to automate attacks and leverage their impact. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that exist in hardware, software, and communication layers. Various types of cyber attacks include distributed denial of service (DDoS), phishing, man-in-the-middle, password, remote, privilege escalation, and malware. Due to new-generation attacks and evasion techniques, traditional protection systems such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, antivirus software, access control lists, etc., are no longer effective in detecting these sophisticated attacks. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find innovative and more feasible solutions to prevent cyber attacks. The paper first extensively explains the main reasons for cyber attacks. Then, it reviews the most recent attacks, attack patterns, and detection techniques. Thirdly, the article discusses contemporary technical and nontechnical solutions for recognizing attacks in advance. Using trending technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, cloud platforms, big data, and blockchain can be a promising solution for current and future cyber attacks. These technological solutions may assist in detecting malware, intrusion detection, spam identification, DNS attack classification, fraud detection, recognizing hidden channels, and distinguishing advanced persistent threats. However, some promising solutions, especially machine learning and deep learning, are not resistant to evasion techniques, which must be considered when proposing solutions against intelligent cyber attacks.},

	abstract = {Computer Networks have seen an exponential development due to the ubiquitous reach of the communication networks. However, the cloud security and potential threats has become a major challenge. Hence, many available research works primarily focus on network security to protect the services, resources and networks from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) threats and others. Techniques which are employed to provide security in the network include detection system, firewall, and the authentication tools. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an important part of the security system that is used to provide secure and reliable services to end users. This type of service may be provided by continually analyzing and monitoring network traffic for intrusions and abnormalities. In this study, a complete examination of recent work on Intrusion Detection System mechanisms with respect to computer networks and cloud computing is described in order to assess the efficiency of various approaches used in system security. Then, the various algorithms such as Machine learning based methodologies are analyzed with its strength and weakness. This survey aims at analyzing various security attacks and the available conventional and machine learning methodologies used to detect and prevent Intrusions on Computer networks and Cloud Computing network resources.},

	abstract = {Network function virtualization (NFV) is a rapidly growing technology that permits network operators to issue their virtualized network functions (VNFs) with cheaper commodity servers. There are various VNFs, namely firewalls, switches, and virtual routers. However, detecting denial of service (DDoS) attacked VNFs is challenging as VNF behaviors are complicated and dynamic due to network traffic in the cloud. Therefore, the proposed work implemented an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect DDoS attacks in the network. The proposed IDS is named a wrapper feature selection-based hybrid deep learning model (WF-HDL). The DDoS detection model undergoes three stages: pre-processing, feature selection, and detection. The pre-processing is achieved by the z-score normalization technique, followed by a wrapper-based feature selection achieved using the Pelican optimization algorithm (POA). Finally, the DDoS attacks are detected using deep auto-encoder-convolutional gated recurrent unit (DAE-CGRU). The proposed model detected the network's normal and attacked VNF behaviors more accurately. It can train different kinds of VNF behaviour models. In the proposed work, two VNF models, a virtual firewall and a virtual router are trained using a CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. The proposed attack detection model achieves high accuracy at 99.69\%, precision at 99.03\%, recall at 99.07\%, f1-score at 99.05\%, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) at 99.85\%.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are deliberate attempts to interrupt the regular traffic of a specific server, network, organization, by flooding the victim or its neighbouring servers with network traffic. Identification of such attacks using various models is challenging due to the substantial modifications in their regular pattern and traffic rates. An automated detection approach is used to mitigate this issue, by limiting the feature space, which minimizes the model's overfitting and computational time. The CICDDoS2019 data set containing extensive DDoS attacks are used to train and access the proposed methodology in a cloud-based context. The relevant features are extracted using the Extra Tree classifier and they are fed to the Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Random Forest. Consequently, the proposed model can be used to detect DDoS attacks effectively.},

	abstract = {Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a license for access to a specific cloud application through the Internet. However, these services are delayed and sometimes totally disrupted because of the Internet's unavailability that provides opportunities for a lot of attacks. Research into the security of the cloud focuses mainly on prohibiting malicious users from using the cloud to launch attacks, such as those currently done by botnets, including launching a DDoS attack, sending spam, etc. Because SaaS uses computational power from both servers of cloud computing providers and machines of customers, we argue that SaaS may be elaborately exploited in an unprecedented way as an attack vector for botnets. The previous research work has developed a novel framework for detecting the attacks with the aid of a deep learning approach (Doriguzzi-Corin et al., 2020). Although the attack node in the network has been identified, they were not diminished. An enhanced and powerful adversary model is to be provided as a solution to this problem. Hence, this paper intends to develop a novel framework for attack node mitigation using a secure SaaS Framework. The main contribution of this paper provides an attack detection process that takes place in Deep Belief Network (DBN), in which the weight, as well as activation function, are finetuned with Median Fitness oriented Sea Lion Optimization algorithm (MFSLnO). If DBN detects an attack node, the control is transferred to a lightweight bait approach that reliably mitigates the most common attack nodes without disrupting regular connections will be deployed. The performance of the proposed work yielded the best results over the traditional models with a packet loss ratio of 16\% and throughput of 89\%.(c) 2020 The Authors.

	abstract = {The emergence of vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) technology is changing cloud computing and transportation ecosystems. V2C technology enables the development of smart services, such as driving assistance and vehicle maintenance, that transmit information to the driver. Recent studies have primarily focused on services. To date, there has not been sufficient research on security functions to detect abnormal behaviors on virtual application. If an abnormal behavior occurs in the application, the service not only notices the wrong information to driver, but also affects the transportation system around the vehicle. To defend against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, system resources should be monitored constantly. However, continuous monitoring is difficult because V2C services change dynamically according to the service environment. In addition, rule-based or supervised monitoring is impossible for each of the numerous services provided by a cloud computing center. In this paper, we propose an intelligent application protection mechanism for smart vehicle services in a V2C environment that detects abnormal behavior through image-based system resource monitoring using artificial intelligence (ISRM-AI) to improve cloud vehicle service security. The ISRM-AI generates images about system information such as CPU, network, memory on V2C cloud services. Also, the mechanism analyzes the status using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect abnormal behavior of the each services. We constructed a service environment to test the performance of the proposed mechanism. In addition, we simulated the proposed mechanism \& x2019;s ability to detect DDoS attacks using real attack data. The proposed mechanism guarantees the reliability of a smart service by enhancing the security of the V2C environment.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a vast revolution in information technology (IT) that inhibits scalable and virtualized sources to end users with low infrastructure cost and maintenance. They also have much flexibility and these resources are supervised by various management organizations and provided over the Internet by known standards, formats, and networking protocols. Legacy protocols and underlying technologies consist of vulnerabilities and bugs which open doors for intrusion by network attackers. Attacks as distributed denial of service (DDoS) are one of most frequent attacks, which impose heavy damage and affect performance of the cloud. In this research work, DDoS attack detection is easily identified in an optimized way through a novel algorithm, namely, the proposed gradient hybrid leader optimization (GHLBO) algorithm. This optimized algorithm is responsible to train a deep stacked autoencoder (DSA) that detects the attack in an efficient manner. Here, fusion of features is carried out by deep maxout network (DMN) with an overlap coefficient, and augmentation of data is carried out by the oversampling process. Furthermore, the proposed GHLBO is generated by integrating the gradient descent and hybrid leader-based optimization (HLBO) algorithm. Also, this proposed method is assessed by various performance metrics, such as the true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), and testing accuracy with values attained as 0.909, 0.909, and 0.917, accordingly.},

Moreover, DDoS produces malicious traffic in cloud structure, and thus consumes cloud resources. In this paper, an effective DDoS attack detection model, named fractional anti corona virus student psychology optimization-based deep residual network (FACVSPO-based DRN) is implemented using spark architecture. The devised FACVSPO approach is newly designed by incorporating anti coronavirus optimization (ACVO) algorithm, fractional calculus (FC) and student psychology based optimization (SPBO) model. Moreover, the hybrid correlative scheme is designed for extracting significant features for attack detection. The DRN structure is utilized for performing attack recognition, which categorizes the data as normal or attack. In addition, the DRN classifier is trained by the developed FACVSPO approach. The developed attack detection model outperformed other existing techniques in terms of testing accuracy, true negative rate (TNR), true positive rate (TPR) of 0.9236, 0.9141, and 0.9412, respectively. The testing accuracy of the implemented model is 12.02\%, 8.92\%, 7.27\%, 6.30\%, 5.68\%, and 1.20\% better than the existing methods, such as Taylor-elephant herd optimisation based deep belief network (TEHO-DBN), deep learning, deep neural network (DNN), multiple kernel learning, Fuzzy Taylor elephant herd optimisation (EHO)-based DBN, fractional anti corona virus optimization-deep neuro fuzzy network (FACVO-based DNFN), respectively. Similarly, the TNR is 10.14\%, 6.88\%, 5.94\%, 5.46\%, 4.25\%, and 3.28\% and TPR is 12.33\%, 9.46\%, 8.05\%, 7.41\%, 6.02\%, and 3.04\% better than the existing methods.},

	abstract = {One of the main essential security issues of cloud computing is the detection and prevention of network intrusions. The gaps in the network directly affect the security of the cloud as it is the foundation of it. Attacks in the cloud are launched either by compromised nodes of the network outside of the cloud or by virtual machines (VMs) within the cloud network. So, monitoring both external and internal traffic of the cloud network is of great importance. In this paper, a machine learning method performing accurate clustering of network data to detect DDoS attacks has been proposed. The method uses a feature selection technique to increase the efficiency of data clustering. To provide the feature selection the PCA algorithm has been used. For the dataset formed on selected features, the DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise), Agglomerative Clustering, and k-means algorithms are applied. In the experiment, the clustering results of the methods using fewer features were higher on all metrics than the clustering results of the methods using all the features. Compared to the standard algorithms, the PCA + DBSCAN, PCA + Agglomerative, and PCA + k-means algorithms obtained higher values on the Adjusted Rand Index metric and reached 0.8989, 0.9130, 0.9094 values, respectively. The effectiveness of the approach also was evaluated on the other clustering metrics and obtained high results. The proposed system can be installed in both internal and external cloud infrastructure. This allows, to detect attacks on the external cloud network, as well as on the internal physical network or in the virtual network between hypervisors.},

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm that provides centralized control, programmability, and a global view of topology in the controller. SDN is becoming more popular due to its high audibility, which also raises security and privacy concerns. SDN must be outfitted with the best security scheme to counter the evolving security attacks. A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a network attack that floods network links with illegitimate data using high-rate packet transmission. Illegitimate data traffic can overload network links, causing legitimate data to be dropped and network services to be unavailable. Low-rate Distributed Denial-of-Service (LDDoS) is a recent evolution of DDoS attack that has been emerged as one of the most serious vulnerabilities for the Internet, cloud computing platforms, the Internet of Things (IoT), and large data centers. Moreover, LDDoS attacks are more challenging to detect because this attack sends a large amount of illegitimate data that are disguised as legitimate traffic. Thus, traditional security mechanisms such as symmetric/asymmetric detection schemes that have been proposed to protect SDN from DDoS attacks may not be suitable or inefficient for detecting LDDoS attacks. Therefore, more research studies are needed in this domain. There are several survey papers addressing the detection mechanisms of DDoS attacks in SDN, but these studies have focused mainly on high-rate DDoS attacks. Alternatively, in this paper, we present an extensive survey of different detection mechanisms proposed to protect the SDN from LDDoS attacks using machine learning approaches. Our survey describes vulnerability issues in all layers of the SDN architecture that LDDoS attacks can exploit. Current challenges and future directions are also discussed. The survey can be used by researchers to explore and develop innovative and efficient techniques to enhance SDN's protection against LDDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {Malicious attacks are becoming more prevalent due to the growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in homes, offices, transportation, healthcare, and other locations. By incorporating fog computing into IoT, attacks can be detected in a short amount of time, as the distance between IoT devices and fog devices is smaller than the distance between IoT devices and the cloud. Machine learning is frequently used for the detection of attacks due to the huge amount of data available from IoT devices. However, the problem is that fog devices may not have enough resources, such as processing power and memory, to detect attacks in a timely manner. This paper proposes an approach to offload the machine learning model selection task to the cloud and the real-time prediction task to the fog nodes. Using the proposed method, based on historical data, an ensemble machine learning model is built in the cloud, followed by the real-time detection of attacks on fog nodes. The proposed approach is tested using the NSL-KDD dataset. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of several performance measures, such as execution time, precision, recall, accuracy, and ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing security has been a critical issue with its increase in demand. One of the most challenging problems in cloud computing is detecting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The attack detection framework for the DDoS attack is tricky because of its nonlinear nature of interruption activities, atypical system traffic behaviour, and many features in the problem space. As a result, creating defensive solutions against these attacks is critical for mainstream cloud computing adoption. In this novel research, by using performance parameters, perplexed-based classifiers with and without feature selection will be compared with the existing machine learning algorithms such as naive Bayes and random forest to prove the efficacy of the perplexed-based classification algorithm. Comparing the performance parameters like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, the proposed algorithm has an accuracy of 99\%, which is higher than the existing algorithms, proving that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in detecting the DDoS attacks in cloud computing systems. To extend our research in the area of nature-inspired computing, we compared our perplexed Bayes classifier feature selection with nature-inspired feature selection like genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and found that our classifier is highly efficient in comparison with GA and PSO and their accuracies are 2\% and 8\%, respectively, less than those of perplexed Bayes classifier.},

	abstract = {In device-to-device (D2D) communications, distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks can be quite detri-mental because it can result in network structure destruction. Towards this end, the research objective of this paper is to identify and prevent DDoS and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks (i.e., SYN, Slowloris) in a D2D communication environment. Specifically, by replicating a real-world scenario, we emulate SLowloris attacks in a D2D communication network and generate a D2D Network-specific Slowloris dataset. This dataset along with the CICDDoS2019 dataset was then used to train our proposed Machine learning (ML) model that aids in the detection and prevention of DDoS attacks (Slowloris and SYN) in the considered D2D framework. The whole process of how to construct an emulation network for D2D communication and test it against a variety of attacks and implementations is also demonstrated in the paper. To quantify the detection accuracy in the context of DDoS and DoS attacks, we use various ML algorithms such as Random Forest, Light GBM, XGBoost, and Ada Boost and study their performance with the aid of extensive emulation. The results collected revealed that both Slowloris and CICDDoS2019 datasets achieve greater accuracy with Random Forest. Consequently, the results compel us to develop a technique for combining the identification of DDoS and DoS attacks in binary classification Random Forests with the binary decision. The proposed technique has been evaluated and compared with other related approaches in the open literature demonstrating significant performance in terms of identification and prevention time, processing and memory resources required, and device battery consumption, without affecting the accuracy of the attack identification. Hence, we advocate that our proposed technique can be extremely beneficial in preventing DDoS and DoS attacks in a D2D communication environment, where its lifetime and capabilities are mainly associated with the resources of the D2D device (i.e., CPU, Memory, and battery life).},

	abstract = {Conventional Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) systems are becoming increasingly challenging to manage due to hardware and software dependencies. Moreover, the number and size of conventional PLCs on factory floors continue to increase, and virtualized PLC (vPLC) offers a solution to address these challenges. The utilization of vPLC offers the advantages of streamlining communication between high-level applications and low-level machine operations, enhancing programming ability in process control systems by abstracting control functions from I/O modules, and increasing automation in industrial control networks. Nevertheless, the connection of vPLC to the internet and cloud services presents a considerable cybersecurity risk, and the crucial aspect of information security for vPLCs is ensuring their availability. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can be particularly devastating for vPLCs, as they rely on internet connectivity to function. DDoS attacks on vPLC overwhelm it and causing it to become unavailable. vPLCs manages control systems and if targeted by a DDoS attack, these systems could become unresponsive, leading to significant disruption to industrial processes. Thus, implementing effective DDoS protection measures is crucial for ensuring the availability and reliability of vPLCs in industrial settings. Therefore, this work proposes a Federated learning enabled Threat Intelligence Unit (FedTIU) for detecting DDoS attacks on vPLCs on an Edge Compute Stack near to vPLC. The proposed approach involves collaborative model training using federated learning techniques to gain knowledge of new attack patterns from other industrial sites while maintaining data privacy.},

	abstract = {Due to rising cyber threats, IoT devices' security vulnerabilities are expanding. However, these devices cannot run complicated security algorithms locally due to hardware restrictions. Data must be transferred to cloud nodes for processing, giving attackers an entry point. This research investigates distributed computing on the edge, using AI-enabled IoT devices and container orchestration tools to process data in real time at the network edge. The purpose is to identify and mitigate DDoS assaults while minimizing CPU usage to improve security. It compares typical IoT devices with and without AI-enabled chips, container orchestration, and assesses their performance in running machine learning models with different cluster settings. The proposed architecture aims to empower IoT devices to process data locally, minimizing the reliance on cloud transmission and bolstering security in IoT environments. The results correlate with the update in the architecture. With the addition of AI-enabled IoT device and container orchestration, there is a difference of 60\% between the new architecture and traditional architecture where only Raspberry Pi were being used.},

	abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems play a crucial role in overseeing and controlling renewable energy sources like solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal resources. Nevertheless, with the expansion of conventional SCADA network infrastructures, there arise significant challenges in managing and scaling due to increased size, complexity, and device diversity. Using Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology in traditional SCADA network infrastructure offers management, scaling and flexibility benefits. However, as the integration of SDN-based SCADA systems with modern technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and big data analytics increases, cybersecurity becomes a major concern for these systems. Therefore, cyber-physical energy systems (CPES) should be considered together with all energy systems. One of the most dangerous types of cyber-attacks against SDN-based SCADA systems is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks disrupt the management of energy resources, causing service interruptions and increasing operational costs. Therefore, the first step to protect against DDoS attacks in SDN-based SCADA systems is to develop an effective intrusion detection system. This paper proposes a Decision Tree-based Ensemble Learning technique to detect DDoS attacks in SDN-based SCADA systems by accurately distinguishing between normal and DDoS attack traffic. For training and testing the ensemble learning models, normal and DDoS attack traffic data are obtained over a specific simulated experimental network topology. Techniques based on feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are used to optimize the performance of the decision tree ensemble models. Experimental results show that feature selection, combination of different decision tree ensemble models, and hyperparameter tuning can lead to a more accurate machine learning model with better performance detecting DDoS attacks against SDN-based SCADA systems.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of services is one of the most dangerously planned attacks in cloud computing, resulting in huge losses of data and money for both the cloud services providers and the users of these services. Many efforts have been performed to help protect the cloud from these attacks using machine learning techniques. This study focuses on enhancing the efficiency of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, considered one of the cheapest and fastest classifiers. Still, it has some problems resulting from its equation's statistical nature. The nature of this classifier is based on multiplication, resulting in inaccurate classification due to the zero-frequency issue and the fact that it assumes that features are independent. This research proposed a framework handling the selection of a set of highly independent features following an iterative feature selection approach using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Mutual Information, and Chi-squared and then selecting other subsets of features from these sets to reach a set of highly independent features. After that, we used a specific algorithm handling the data pre-processing to handle the zero-frequency problem where we used the Mode to replace the missing values, and if the mode was zero, it used the mean instead. Still, if the record's label is zero, we get the value of the previous record with zero labels. After that, we handled the data imbalances using SMOTE. These enhancements increased both accuracy for the mutual information model by 2\% and the average overall accuracy and precision by 1.5\%.},

	abstract = {Interconnected cyber infrastructures, accessible via the Internet, are a common target of DDoS attacks intending to downgrade their operations and services. Collaborative protection mechanisms are prime candidates to defend against massive attacks but, although collaborations were instrumental in the Internet success story, this is largely not extended to multidomain cyber security. Notably, collaborative DDoS detection is hindered by data privacy legislations, while mitigation is limited to operations of stand-alone rigid firewalls. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose a Federated Learning schema for collaborative privacy-aware DDoS detection. Coordination is orchestrated by a third trusted party that aggregates machine learning models proposed by collaborators based on their private attack and benign traces, without exchanging sensitive data. Attacks detected via the privacy-aware federated model are subsequently mitigated by efficient and scalable firewalls, implemented within the eXpress Data Path (XDP) data plane programmability framework. Our approach was evaluated using production traffic traces in terms of packet classification accuracy and packet processing performance. We conclude that our proposed Federated Learning framework enabled collaborators to accurately classify benign and attack packets, thereby improving individual domain accuracy. Furthermore, our data plane programmable firewalls promptly mitigated large-scale attacks in emulated federated cyber infrastructures.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks consumes the resources of traditional or cloud computing networks, resulting in the network unable to provide normal services. Therefore, accurate detection of DDoS attacks can avoid greater losses and provide an important guarantee for network space security. But with the rapid development of the Internet, the network scale is becoming larger and larger, and the structure is becoming more and more complex. Network data shows large-scale heterogeneous characteristics, which lead to data processing becomes more difficult and the traditional algorithms cannot accurately identify attack traffic. Therefore, how to accurately and efficiently detect DDoS attacks in large-scale networks has become a new challenge. To deal this problem, this paper proposes a novel DDoS attack detection framework. Which has mainly made three contributions: (i) Representation of large-scale heterogeneous network data by tensor; (ii) A multi-modal denoising algorithm based on tensor SVD is proposed; (iii) An efficient anomaly detection architecture suitable for large-scale networks is proposed, which combines (i), (ii) and XGBoost classification model. Experiments show that the framework can achieve a high detection rate of 98.84\%, and has the characteristics of well extendable, strong noise-robust and fast detection speed.},

	abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), and cloud computing are receiving significant attention in 5G networks. However, this attention creates a new challenge for security provisioning in these integrated technologies. Research in the field of SDN, NFV, cloud computing, and 5G has recently focused on the intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS). Existing IDPS solutions are inadequate, which could cause large resource wastage and several security threats. To alleviate security issues, timely detection of an attacker is important. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that is referred to as multilayered intrusion detection and prevention (ML-IDP) in an SDN/NFV-enabled cloud of 5G networks. The proposed approach defends against security attacks using artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we employed five layers: data acquisition layer, switches layer, domain controllers (DC) layer, smart controller (SC) layer, and virtualization layer (NFV infrastructure). User authentication is held in the first layer using the Four-Q-Curve algorithm. To address the flow table overloading attack in the switches layer, the game theory approach, which is executed in the IDP agent, is proposed. The involvement of the IDP agent is to completely avoid a flow table overloading attack by a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, and thus, it updates the current state of all switches. In the DC layer, packets are processed and classified into two classes (normal and suspicious) by a Shannon Entropy function. Normal packets are forwarded to the cloud via the SC. Suspicious packets are sent to the VNF using a growing multiple self-organization map (GM-SOM). The proposed ML-IDP system is evaluated using NS3.26 for different security attacks, including IP Spoofing, flow table overloading, DDoS, Control Plane Saturation, and host location hijacking. From the experiment results, we proved that the ML-IDP with AI-based defense mechanisms effectively detects and prevents attacks.},

	abstract = {Our paramount task is to examine and detect network attacks, is one of the daunting tasks because the variety of attacks are day by day existing in colossal number. The program proposed detects botnet attacks using the newest CSE-CIC-IDS2018 cyber dataset published by the Canadian Cybersecurity Establishment (CIC). The cyber dataset can be accessed on AWS (Amazon Web Services). The realistic network dataset consists of all the modern and existing attacks such as Brute-force attacks and password cracking, Heartbleed, Botnet, DoS (Denial of Service), DDoS also known as Distributed Denial of Service, Web attacks i.e. vulnerable web app attacks, and infiltration of the network from inside. The objective of the proposed research is to identify a classification of Botnet attacks. Botnet attack is a Trojan Horse malware attack that poses a serious security threat to the banking and financial sectors. Since a specific classifier could possibly work for such datasets it is crucial to finish a comparative examination of classifiers in order to achieve the most noteworthy execution in such basic detection of network attacks. The proposed framework is to incorporate different classifier methods such as KNearset Neighbor classifier, Naive Bayes, Adaboost with Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine classifier, Random Forest classifier, and Artificial Intelligence to distinguish a portrayal of botnet attacks on the recent and realistic cyber dataset CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The results of the classification are given as precise precision for the specific classifiers. And furthermore, the proposed framework uses the Calibration curve as a standard approach in analytical methods which generates reliability diagrams to check the predicted probabilities of various classifiers are well-calibrated or not. Finally, the displayed graph proves how well the artificial intelligence technique outperforms all other classifiers which generates reliability diagrams to check the predicted probabilities of various classifiers are well-calibrated or not.

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy inference systems, approximate reasoning, and derivative-free optimization approaches like evolutionary computation, among others, are all components of Soft Computing (SC), an innovative method for building computationally intelligent methods. Due to its widespread use and benefits, cloud computing is currently a major focus for researchers. The distributed nature of cloud computing and its complete reliance on the internet for service provision present security challenges, the most serious of which is insider Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) which results in complete deactivation of services. Based on machine learning and the cloud, this study proposes a novel method for improving computing network security. Using a trust-based secure cloud environment and the Kernel principal component encoder architecture, the network monitoring is carried out. The soft computing environment-based detection of a cyberattack on the network is the purpose for the security enhancement. Throughput, QoS, latency, and packet delivery ratio for various monitored cyber security datasets are the focus of the experimental analysis. The proposed technique attained network security analysis of 89\%, throughput of 98\%, QoS of 66\%, latency of 59\%, packet delivery ratio of 83\%.},

	abstract = {A Denial of Service (DDoS) attack consumes the network bandwidth and computing resources of a targeted system, preventing the target system from being DDoS attacked by unauthorized users. This research work proposed a modified feature selection-based neural network for efficient DDoS attack detection. The proposed method is divided into three stages: feature selection, training, and testing. For the implementation of the proposed work using MATLAB 2020 software, MATLAB is a well-known academic as well as an industrial research software package for this work. In R2020 MATLAB, the proposed method is designed and simulated. There are different types of DDoS attacks present on the cloud internet. This research work uses the Canadian Institute of Cyber Security (CICIDS2017) data set to perform the proposed methodology. This data set was selected for classification because it consists of 80 parameters. Other than the benign traffic, as per the tools used, the flow records are labeled as `Slowloris', `Slowhttptest', `Hulk', and `Begian'. The proposed method shows good results in terms of accuracy, precision, selectivity, sensitivity, and confusion matrix (C.M.). The presented method shows an accuracy of 99\% and the other parameters are discussed in the simulation and result section.},

	abstract = {Internet and cloud-based technologies have facilitated the implementation of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, these networks are susceptible to emerging attacks. This paper proposes a novel lightweight system for detecting both high- and low-volume Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in IoT networks, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA) and t-Test for DDoS Attack Detection (GADAD). The GADAD system employs edge-based technologies and has three phases. In the first phase, it creates and preprocesses an HL-IoT (High- and Low-volume attacks in IoT networks) dataset, which includes both high- and low-volume DDoS attacks. The second phase introduces a novel and lightweight method, called GAStats, for optimal feature selection using the GA and statistical parameters (Stats.). In the third phase, the system trains three tree-based Machine Learning (ML) models: Random Forest (RF), Extra-Tree (ET), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), along with other ML models, using both the self-generated HL-IoT dataset and the publicly available ToN-IoT dataset. The evaluation includes the assessment of key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), computation time, and scalability analysis with overall system performance. The experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the feature selection method in optimizing the system's efficiency in detecting DDoS attacks in IoT networks, along with a reduction in computation time compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

	abstract = {For the purpose of obtaining an answer to a spoofing IP issue and related problems in the cloud computing (CC) environment, a novel path identifier is recommended, in which a new packet approach with a new identifier (ID) is produced to every user or client system. For the purpose of identification of the spoofing attack, any watermark image pattern is introduced. Following this, the hypervisor is employed to ascertain plausible trust relationships among the VMs by considering personal sources that can be trusted along with utilizing empirical Bayesian inference (EBI) for the purpose of combining the VMs. With a restricted budget of resources for the maximized detection of attacks, an optimal detection load distribution strategy by improved cuckoo search (ICS) over VMs can be used, which thus provides the intended solution to the hypervisor. The ICS algorithm directs a hypervisor so as to assert among the VMs the optimal load distribution, taking into consideration real time, which causes maximization of the DDoS attacks and detection of transmission control protocol (TCP) flood attacks. Lastly, a fuzzy extreme learning machine (FELM) classifier is proposed in order to detect the attacks.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of IoT services has spurred a surge in network attacks, heightening cybersecurity concerns. Essential to network defense, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPSs) identify malicious activities, including denial of service (DoS), distributed denial of service (DDoS), botnet, brute force, infiltration, and Heartbleed. This study focuses on leveraging unsupervised learning for training detection models to counter these threats effectively. The proposed method utilizes basic autoencoders (bAEs) for dimensionality reduction and encompasses a three-stage detection model: one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) and deep autoencoder (dAE) attack detection, complemented by density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for attack clustering. Accurately delineated clusters aid in mapping attack tactics. The MITRE ATT\&CK framework establishes a ``Cyber Threat Repository{''}, cataloging attacks and tactics, enabling immediate response based on priority. Leveraging preprocessed and unlabeled normal network traffic data, this approach enables the identification of novel attacks while mitigating the impact of imbalanced training data on model performance. The autoencoder method utilizes reconstruction error, OCSVM employs a kernel function to establish a hyperplane for anomaly detection, while DBSCAN employs a density-based approach to identify clusters, manage noise, accommodate diverse shapes, automatically determining cluster count, ensuring scalability, and minimizing false positives and false negatives. Evaluated on standard datasets such as CIC-IDS2017 and CSECIC-IDS2018, the proposed model outperforms existing state of art methods. Our approach achieves accuracies exceeding 98\% for the two datasets, thus confirming its efficacy and effectiveness for application in efficient intrusion detection systems.},

	abstract = {In today's society, the cloud is essential for communication since it allows access to important information anytime and anywhere. However, cloud services also attract hackers who want to exploit online details. This has caused significant changes in the cyber-attack landscape. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is the most common attack. Traditional tools like firewalls and encryption can mitigate these risks, but new models are needed to cope with the changing nature of cyber-attacks. Detecting DDoS attacks is particularly challenging since network traffic data is complex and often contains unnecessary features. To address this, a new approach is proposed using Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature selection and classification. The NSL-KDD dataset is used to evaluate the performance of this new model with three main steps: Data Preprocessing, Hyper-parameter Optimization, and Classification. Our method performed better in all four metrics, such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-score, with rates of 97.7, 98.1, 97.7, and 97.8, respectively. The multiclass classification detection rate for DOS was 100\%. Similarly, the detection rates for Probe, R2L, and U2R were 98\%, 95\%, and 80\%, respectively. Python version 3.6 with Keras 2.2.4 and TensorFlow Engine was used in this paper.},

	abstract = {The Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is one of the main issues faced by cloud service providers due to their intricate nature. The main aim of this attack is to disrupt the services of authorized users by forwarding massive malicious requests to the victim system. Even though the modern Artificial Intelligence-powered intrusion detection system offers improved benefits, it suffers from analyzing the traces of intrusion in the massive network flow. This article presents a novel Chaos-based Henry Gas Solubility Optimization-Weight initialization based-rectified linear Unit (HGSO-WIB-ReLU) framework to identify different types of DoS attacks like HTTP flood attacks, DNS flood attacks, and ICMP flood attacks. The main aim of this technique is to identify the low rate of DoS attacks which the state-of-art techniques often based on statistical analysis and machine learning are incapable of accomplishing. Convolutional neural network architecture incorporates the WIB-ReLU activation function primarily to prevent vanishing gradient issues and provide efficient training. The WIB-ReLU framework's hyperparameters are primarily improved using the HGSO method by increasing the classifier's accuracy rate for detecting DoS attacks. In this way, the proposed model minimized the high false positive rate in identifying low-rate DoS attacks in large datasets. Different benchmark datasets such as BUET- DDoS2020, CIC DoS Attacks, and Low Rate DDoS are used to conduct the experiments and the efficiency of the model is verified in terms of accuracy, F1-measure, and precision score. When evaluated using the BUET-DDoS, CIC-DoS, and Low rate DDoS datasets, the proposed model offers an accuracy of 97\%, 96.67\%, and 96\%, respectively. The experimental analysis conducted demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed HGSO-WIB-ReLU framework when compared to the different state-of-art methodologies.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is perhaps the most enticing innovation in the present figuring situation. It gives an expense-effective arrangement by diminishing the enormous forthright expense of purchasing equipment foundations and processing power. Fog computing is an additional help to cloud infrastructure by utilizing a portion of the less-registered undertaking at the edge devices, reducing the end client's reaction time, such as IoT. However, most of the IoT devices are resource-constrained, and there are many devices that cyber attacks could target. Cyber-attacks such as bottleneck, Dos, DDoS, and botnets are still significant threats in the IoT environment. Botnets are currently the most significant threat on the internet. A set of infected systems connected online and directed by an adversary to carry out malicious actions without authorization or authentication is known as a botnet. A botnet can compromise the system and steal the data. It can also perform attacks, like Phishing, spamming, and more. To overcome the critical issue, we exhibit a novel botnet attack detection approach that could be utilized in fog computing situations to dispense with the attack using the programmable nature of the software-defined network (SDN) environment. We carefully tested the most recent dataset for our proposed technique, standard and extended performance evaluation measures, and current DL models. To further illustrate overall performance, our findings are cross-validated. The proposed method performs better than previous ones in correctly identifying 99.98\% of multi-variant sophisticated bot attacks. Additionally, the time of our suggested method is 0.022(ms), indicating good speed efficiency results.},

	abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a modern paradigm that provides a platform for implementing reliable, centrally managed, and automated security solutions for conventional and new generation networks, such as IoT, cloud computing, 5G/6G mobile communication networks, and vehicular communications. In these com-plex systems, manual security operations can delay or obstruct the identification, mitigation, and prevention of ever-increasing sophisticated threats. Thus, the idea of security automation for networks using the SDN paradigm has become fundamental, given that SDN was created to facilitate the operation and management of complex networks with minimal human intervention, which is considered error-prone. This survey studies the state-of-the-art research efforts concerned with security automation in SDN environments. We identified and ranked various classes of security solutions with different levels of automation and complexity. The level of automation is measured using four well-defined qualitative parameters: self-healing, self-adaptation, self-configuration, and self-optimization. The complexity is characterized by the amount of processing and storage resources and implementation requirements. This work represents the first endeavor to analyze the level of automation and complexity of security solutions in SDN environments. Our findings reveal important advances in the area of security automation in SDN. However, there are still several open problems and challenges, which we detail in this work.},

	abstract = {Security is an essential element for the effective operation of modern network infrastructures. OF@TEIN playground over TEIN (Trans-Eurasia Information Network), is a multi-site cloud with distributed edge nodes has brought the security challenges. In order to address the security challenges of distributed edge nodes, recently, SmartX Multi-Sec framework has been launched. However, it is based on a signature-based network threat detection mechanism. Depending on the current complex and heterogeneous nature of network traffic which is continuously increasing in scale, machine learning capabilities are more effective to recognize hidden and complex patterns of network traffic than traditional signature-based methods. Moreover, in response to the weaknesses of current security solutions, the zero-trust model manipulates that no network is reliable. Therefore, cloud operators should monitor and verify all network traffic continuously. So, by considering the above challenges, we are going to enhance the SmartX Multi-Sec framework by focusing on zero trust and incorporating machine learning techniques for network threat detection (specifically DDoS attacks). Moreover, its prototype version has been realized on the OF@TEIN playground to show its effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Application-layer distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks incapacitate systems by using up their resources, causing service interruptions, financial losses, and more. Consequently, advanced deep-learning techniques are used to detect and mitigate these attacks in cloud infrastructures. However, in mobile edge computing (MEC), it becomes economically impractical to equip each node with defensive resources, as these resources may largely remain unused in edge devices. Furthermore, current methods are mainly concentrated on improving the accuracy of DDoS attack detection and saving CPU resources, neglecting the effective allocation of computational power for benign tasks under DDoS attacks. To address these issues, this paper introduces SecEG, a secure and efficient strategy against DDoS attacks for MEC that integrates container-based task isolation with lightweight online anomaly detection on edge nodes. More specifically, a new model is proposed to analyze resource contention dynamics between DDoS attacks and benign tasks. Subsequently, by employing periodic packet sampling and real-time attack intensity predicting, an autoencoder-based method is proposed to detect DDoS attacks. We leverage an efficient scheduling method to optimize the edge resource allocation and the service quality for benign users during DDoS attacks. When executed in the real-world edge environment, our experimental findings validate the efficacy of the proposed SecEG strategy. Compared to conventional methods, the service rate of benign requests increases by 23\% under intense DDoS attacks, and the CPU resource is saved up to 35\%.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing offer various services over the Internet based on pay-per-use concept. Therefore, many organizations have already adopted this system to attract the users with its desirable features. However, due to its design, makes it vulnerable to malicious attacks. This demands an Intrusion Detection System that can detect such attacks with high detection accuracy in cloud environment. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection system that combines a fuzzy c means clustering (FCM) algorithm with support vector machine (SVM) to improve the accuracy of the detection system in cloud computing environment. The proposed system is implemented and compared with existing mechanisms. The NSL-KDD dataset is used for experiments. Based on performance evaluation and comparative analysis, the results obtained using this new hybrid mechanism (FCM-SVM) show that the proposed system can detect the anomalies with high detection accuracy and low false alarm rates over the existing techniques.},

	abstract = {Information technology organizations have experienced rapid growth in recent years, resulting in scalability, mobility, and flexibility challenges. Those organizations move their data to the cloud because security and privacy are major concerns. As cloud computing becomes more popular, security has become an important concern. These confidential data are vulnerable to attacks/malicious or intruders due to the characteristics of the cloud. In order to address the growing concern of real-time intruders, a variety of intrusion detection systems (IDS) used specifically for cloud environments with the aim of enhancing overall security. There are, however, some limitations and known attacks that can be overcome by those IDSs. We recently proposed a hybrid soft computing based IDS (ST-IDS) for web and cloud environments, but missed some novel web and cloud attacks. Using hybrid teacher learning enabled deep recurrent neural networks and cluster based feature optimization, we propose an IDS scheme for web and cloud computing environments. MMFO (modified manta -ray foraging optimization) is used after feature extraction to select optimal features for further detection. To classify the intrusion in the web-cloud environment, a hybrid teacher-learning enabled deep recurrent neural network (TL-DRNN) is introduced. Our proposed IDS scheme has been validated using benchmark datasets including DARPA LLS DDoS-1.0, CICIDS-2017, and CSIC-2010. The performance of our proposed IDS scheme has been compared to existing IDS schemes using various quality measures.},

	abstract = {With the development of the Internet of Things, a huge number of devices are connected to the network, network traffic is exhibiting massive and low latency characteristics. At the same time, it is becoming cheaper and cheaper to launch DDoS attacks, and the attack traffic is becoming larger and larger. Software-defined networking SDN is proposed as a new network architecture. However, the controller as the core of SDN is vulnerable to DDoS attacks and causes a single point of failure in the network. This paper combines the ideas of distributed and edge computing, firstly, a DDoS attack detection algorithm using heterogeneous integrated feature selection and random forest algorithm is proposed. Then, this DDoS attack detection algorithm is distributed and deployed on the edge equipment switches of SDN to perform distributed edge parallel computing using the residual computing power of the switches for fast and accurate detection of DDoS attacks. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted in the SDN environment using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the performance evaluation metrics of this solution: accuracy, precision, recall and F-value all reach 99.99\%, while the prediction time is only 0.4 s, all metrics are better than other DDoS attack detection methods in the same category. Therefore, this solution is able to detect DDoS attacks in a timely and accurate manner.},

	abstract = {Attackers are increasingly targeting Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which connect industrial devices to the Internet. To construct network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs), which can secure Agriculture 4.0 networks, powerful deep learning (DL) models have recently been deployed. An effective and adaptable intrusion detection system may be implemented by using the architectures of long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network combined with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) for detecting DDoS attacks. The CIC-DDoS2019 dataset was used to design a proposal for detecting different types of DDoS attacks. The dataset was developed using the CICFlowMeter-V3 network. The standard network traffic dataset, including NetBIOS, Portmap, Syn, UDPLag, UDP, and normal benign packets, was used to test the development of deep learning approaches. Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy were among the measures used to assess the model's performance. The suggested technology was able to reach a high degree of precision (100\%). The CNN-LSTM has a score of 100\% with respect to all the evaluation metrics. We used a deep learning method to build our model and compare it to existing systems to determine how well it performs. In addition, we believe that this proposed model has highest possible levels of protection against any cyber threat to Agriculture 4.0.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks persistently proliferate, impacting individuals and Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Deep learning (DL) models are paving the way to address these challenges and the dynamic nature of potential threats. Traditional detection systems, relying on signature-based techniques, are susceptible to next-generation malware. Integrating DL approaches in cloud-edge/federated servers enhances the resilience of these systems. In the Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous networks, DL, particularly federated learning, has gained prominence for attack detection. Unlike conventional models (centralized and localized DL), federated learning does not require access to users' private data for attack detection. This approach is gaining much interest in academia and industry due to its deployment on local and global cloud-edge models. Recent advancements in DL enable training a quality cloud-edge model across various users (collaborators) without exchanging personal information. Federated learning, emphasizing privacy preservation at the cloud-edge terminal, holds significant potential for facilitating privacy-aware learning among collaborators. This paper addresses: (1) The deployment of an optimized deep neural network for network traffic classification. (2) The coordination of federated server model parameters with training across devices in IoT domains. A federated flowchart is proposed for training and aggregating local model updates. (3) The generation of a global model at the cloud-edge terminal after multiple rounds between domains and servers. (4) Experimental validation on the BoT-IoT dataset demonstrates that the federated learning model can reliably detect attacks with efficient classification, privacy, and confidentiality. Additionally, it requires minimal memory space for storing training data, resulting in minimal network delay. Consequently, the proposed framework outperforms both centralized and localized DL models, achieving superior performance.},

	abstract = {The increasing development of decentralized computer systems that interact extensively has increased the criticality of confronting cyberattackers, hackers, and terrorists. With the development of cloud computing and its widespread use, as well as its dispersed and decentralized character, a unique security measure is required to safeguard this architecture. By monitoring, validating, and managing settings, records, internet traffic, usage data, as well as the operations of specific activities, firewalls can distinguish between normal and unexpected behaviours, thus adding additional network security to cloud computing systems. The location of network security mechanisms in cloud computing environment and also the methods employed in such methods are the two primary aspects where many studies have concentrated their efforts. The objective of such studies is to reveal as many incursions as feasible and to improve the pace and correctness of sensing while minimizing false alarms. Nevertheless, these methods have a large computing burden, a poor degree of precision, and a large time consumption. We propose an accurate and complete approach for detecting and preventing assaults in cloud computing environment via the use of a machine learning techniques both supervised and un-supervised. The operational findings demonstrate that the suggested approach substantially increases attack detection, network security correctness, dependability, and accessibility in cloud computing environment, while drastically reducing false alarms.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) security is an umbrella term for the strategies and tools that protect devices connected to the cloud, and the network they use to connect. The IoT connects different objects and devices through the internet to communicate with similarly connected machines or devices. An IoT botnet is a network of infected or cooperated IoT devices that can be remotely organized by cyber attackers for malicious purposes such as spreading malware, stealing data, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and engaging in other types of cybercrimes. The compromised devices can be included in any device connected to the internet and communicate data with, e.g., cameras, smart home appliances, routers, etc. Millions of devices can include an IoT botnet, making it an attractive tool for cyber attackers to launch attacks. Lately, cyberattack detection using deep learning (DL) includes training neural networks on different datasets to automatically detect patterns indicative of cyber threats, which provides an adaptive and proactive approach to cybersecurity. This study presents an evolutionary algorithm with an ensemble DL -based botnet detection and classification (EAEDL-BDC) approach. The goal of the study is to enhance cybersecurity in the cloud -assisted IoT environment via a botnet detection process. In the EAEDL-BDC technique, the primary stage of data normalization using Z -score normalization is performed. For the feature selection process, the EAEDL-BDC technique uses a binary pendulum search algorithm (BPSA). Moreover, a weighted average ensemble of three models, such as the modified Elman recurrent neural network (MERNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM), are used. Additionally, the hyperparameter choice of the DL approaches occurs utilizing the reptile search algorithm (RSA). The experimental outcome of the EAEDL-BDC approach can be examined on the N-BaIoT database. The extensive comparison study implied that the EAEDL-BDC technique reaches a superior accuracy value of 99.53\% compared to other approaches concerning distinct evaluation metrics .},

	abstract = {Cloud-based filtering, as the most commonly used distributed denial of service attack mitigation method in the industry, has flaws that can cause privacy leaks and delays like other cloud applications. A new DDoS mitigation method which moving cloud filtering services to edge servers is proposed in this paper. In this method, the edge servers are deployed at various router locations and run classifiers to filter the traffic passing through. For cutting attack traffic, reserving user traffic and reducing inspection delays, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework is developed to balance the deployment of computing resource and tasks allocation, in which graph neural network used to coding the network structure information transformation as vector, and the traffic information to input into Q-Network to obtain the best allocation results. The simulation experiments show that our method has advantages in optimizing effects and computing time compared with other deployment methods.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of distributed denial of service (DDoS) flooding assaults is one of the most serious risks to cloud computing security. These types of assaults have as their primary objective the exhaustion of the system's available resources, that is, the target of the attack, in order to make the system in question unavailable to authorized users. Internet thieves often conduct flooding assaults of the kind known as DDoS, focusing primarily on the application and network levels. When the computer infrastructure is multi-mesh-geo distributed, includes multi-parallel services, and a high number of domains, it may be difficult to detect assaults. This is particularly true when a substantial number of domains are present. When there are a big number of independent administrative users using the services, the situation gets more complicated. The purpose of this body of research is to identify signs that may be utilized to detect DDoS flooding assaults; this is its main objective. As a result, throughout the course of our study, we established a composite metric that considers application, system, network, and infrastructure elements as possible indicators of the incidence of DDoS assaults. According to our research, DDoS assaults may be triggered by a combination of variables. Investigations of simulated traffic are being conducted in the cloud. High traffic may be the result of flooding assaults. The composite metric-based intrusion detection system will be the name of a one-of-a-kind intrusion detection system (IDS) that has been agreed upon ICMIDS. This system will use K-Means clustering and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to detect whether an effort has been made to flood the cloud environment. CMIDS employs a multi-threshold algorithmic strategy in order to identify malicious traffic occurring on a cloud-based network. Cisco has created this technology. This strategy necessitates a comprehensive investigation of all factors, which is crucial for assuring the continuation of cloud-based computing-based activities. This monitoring system involves the development, administration, and storage of a profile database, denoted as Profile DB. This database is used for recording and using the composite metric for each virtual machine. The results of a series of tests are compared to the ISCX benchmark dataset and statistical settings. The results indicate that ICMIDS has a reasonably high detection rate and the lowest false alarm rate in the majority of situations examined during the series of tests done to validate and verify its efficacy. This was shown by the fact that ICMIDS had the lowest false alarm rate among all examined conditions.},

On one hand, the internet goes through a dramatic transaction period that shapes every aspect of our lives, industry, and business where cloud computing, smart cities, and the Internet of Things (IoT) play a significant role in the advancement of data transfer, storing, and processing. On the other hand, it plays a significant role in emerging advanced versions of different types of cybersecurity attacks especially that are novel, hard-to-detect, and that of distributive never cease-fire characteristics. To mitigate these concerns, we present a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) intrusion detection model that can be implemented in IoT dynamic environments, providing an intelligent intrusion detection mechanism against the second biggest threat to data traffic and transfer on IoT networks. Kalman backpropagation neural network-based DDoS intrusion detection is proposed in this work. The framework is validated through various simulations via the most up to date CICDDoS2019 dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion detection. the proposed solution achieved an average detection accuracy of 94\% with 0.0952 false alarm rate and 97.49\%, 91.22\% for detection rate, and precision respectively.},

	abstract = {Featured Application A potential application of the work concerns the development of secure IIoT architectures for smart manufacturing using blockchain technology and machine learning algorithms. In this paper, a layered architecture incorporating Blockchain technology (BCT) and Machine Learning (ML) is proposed in the context of the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) for smart manufacturing applications. The proposed architecture is composed of five layers covering sensing, network/protocol, transport enforced with BCT components, application and advanced services (i.e., BCT data, ML and cloud) layers. BCT enables gathering sensor access control information, while ML brings its effectivity in attack detection such as DoS (Denial of Service), DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), injection, man in the middle (MitM), brute force, cross-site scripting (XSS) and scanning attacks by employing classifiers differentiating between normal and malicious activity. The design of our architecture is compared to similar ones in the literature to point out potential benefits. Experiments, based on the IIoT dataset, have been conducted to evaluate our contribution, using four metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are evaluated regarding these four metrics. Even if more experiments are required, it is illustrated that the proposed architecture can reduce significantly the number of DDoS, injection, brute force and XSS attacks and threats within an advanced framework for sensor access control in IIoT networks based on a smart contract along with ML classifiers.},

	abstract = {Cloud services are a popular concept used to describe how internet-based services are delivered and maintained. The computer technology environment is being restructured with respect to information preservation. Data protection is of critical importance when storing huge volumes of information. In today's cyber world, an intrusion is a significant security problem. Services, information, and services are all vulnerable to attack in the cloud due to its distributed structure of the cloud. Inappropriate behavior in the connection and in the host is detected using intrusion detection systems (IDS) in the cloud. DDoS attacks are difficult to protect against since they produce massive volumes of harmful information on the network. This assault forces the cloud services to become unavailable to target consumers, which depletes computer resources and leaves the provider exposed to massive financial and reputational losses. Cyber-analyst data mining techniques may assist in intrusion detection. Machine learning techniques are used to create many strategies. Attribute selection techniques are also vital in keeping the dataset's dimensionality low. In this study, one method is provided, and the dataset is taken from the NSL-KDD dataset. In the first strategy, a filtering method called learning vector quantization (LVQ) is used, and in the second strategy, a dimensionality-simplifying method called PCA. The selected attributes from each technique are used for categorization before being tested against a DoS attack. This recent study shows that an LVQ-based SVM performs better than the competition in detecting threats.},

	abstract = {5G networks are highly dynamic and nonhomogeneous networks, making resource management more complex and vulnerable to different network attacks like DDoS, Port Scanning, etc. In addition, Network Slicing plays an important role in these networks in enabling a multitude of 5G applications, services, and use cases. In this context, we propose in this paper, a new approach to secure 5G network slices by developing a models' orchestrator providing an adaptive Machine-Learning (ML) models as-a-Service. Specifically, the proposed models' orchestrator is a cloud server that acts as a decision-making entity to offer on-demand adaptive ML models to detect potential attacks by tuning and adapting ML parameters and algorithms according to the characteristics of the requester devices/nodes and the real-time conditions of each network slice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of experiments, by training different ML algorithms with different network slices properties. Results show that our approach provides a more efficient and effective way of securing 5G networks compared to traditional methods in terms of respecting the requirements raised by each slice/node of these networks.},

	abstract = {With the arrival of the Internet of Things (IoT) many devices such as sensors, nowadays can communicate with each other and share data easily. However, the IoT paradigm is prone to security concerns as many attackers try to hit the network and make it vulnerable. In this scenario, security concerns are the most important and to address them various models have been designed to overcome these security issues, but still there exist many emerging variants of botnet attacks such as Mirai, Persirai, and Bashlite that exploits the security breaches. This research article aims to investigate cyber security in the advent of B-IDS, DDOS, and malware attacks. For this purpose, different machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine, naive Bayes, linear regression, artificial neural network, decision tree, random forest, the fuzzy classifier, K-nearest neighbor, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting, and tree ensemble have been implemented for botnet attack detection. For performance measures, these algorithms have been tested on nine sensor devices over N-BaIoT datasets to measure the security and accuracy of the intrusion detection system. The results show that the tree-based algorithm achieved more than 99\% accuracy which is quite higher as compared to other tested methods on the same sensor devices.},

	abstract = {Water Torture is a DDoS attack vector that exhausts the processing resources of victim Authoritative DNS Servers. By crafting DNS requests involving names that appear once and are unknown to the victim, attackers bypass the DNS caches of intermediary Recursive DNS Servers (Resolvers), hence forwarding the entire attack traffic to the victim. As a countermeasure, machine learning algorithms have been proposed to filter attack traffic on Resolvers. Our proposed schema implements via programmable data plane methods efficient machine learning algorithms that differentiate between legitimate and DDoS attack traffic within cloud infrastructures. Specifically, we leverage on XDP to implement data plane Naive Bayes Classifier inference and effectively mitigate Water Torture attacks within data center Resolvers. DNS requests regarded as invalid by the Naive Bayes Classifier are dropped within the Linux kernel before any resources are allocated to them, while valid ones are forwarded to the user space to be resolved. Our schema was assessed via a proof of concept setup within a virtualized environment, with learning and testing performed via legitimate and malicious DNS data records with statistical properties consistent with datasets widely reported in the literature. Our experiments mainly focused on evaluating the filtering throughput of the proposed mitigation schema given the constraints imposed by XDP. We conclude that our XDP-based Naive Bayes Classifier significantly decreases the volume of attack traffic within the data plane, thus efficiently safeguarding Resolvers.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack poses a significant threat to the cloud environment that can impoverish the resource availability, engage the server busy, and damage the entire system within a short period. The recent DDoS attacks use clever strategies such as low-rate attacks and attacking as an authenticated user. Apparently, the current research lacks auxiliary defense components to mitigate these attacks and instead mostly relies on a single component to perform attack detection. In this work, we propose a Multi-level defense system, a timely and active lightweight mechanism to handle the above constraints. This defense system introduces a novel filtering component called filter, sniffer, and analyzer (FSA) to discard malicious packets from authenticated users. The malicious packets are further inspected using Game-theory based attack prevention algorithm and sent to the blacklist database for future reference. Here the FSA filtering and game-theory are employed as they are more efficient in the detection of low-rate attacks in specific. Along with this, the defense system also employs a decision tree classifier followed by a phi-entropy component to detect malicious packets. Another novelty of this work is this integration of detection, filtering, and prevention and our experiments show the efficacy of this approach. The results evaluated using the CAIDA dataset shows that our proposed multi-level defense system attains 97\% detection accuracy which outperforms the existing phi-entropy detection system by 10\% absolute gain. In addition to this, the system achieves precision of 93\% and detection rate of 82\% along with 0.06 FAR. This shows that our multi-level defense system is faster and efficient in detecting and preventing the low-rate and high-rate DDoS attacks as compared to existing methods such as phi-Entropy, Generalized Entropy (GE) and Generalized Information Distance (GID) metrics. The future direction of this research work can be further enhanced by exploring different deep learning algorithms for network traffic classification. The deployment of the defense mechanism can be extended into multiple locations using a hybrid deployment model to improve detection accuracy.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is a promising technique and the majority of information technology based services function in this infrastructure, which addresses the need of today's data center. There involve privacy and security problems in the cloud, which affected the utility of the cloud. Various mitigation solutions are developed in existing, in which the attacks continue to elevate in frequency and severity. This calls for a model for addressing the needs of challenging security threats. This article devises novel attack detection and mitigation technology using an optimization-driven deep learning model. Here, the system comprises five modules, like data, data owner, cloud server, cloud user, and thin provision virtual volume. Here, each entity performs its own operations. The proposed technique includes five stages, namely, authentication phase, data sharing and communication phase, recorded log file creation phase, attack detection phase, and attack mitigation phase. An initial phase is the authentication phase where an authentication protocol is modeled using different mathematical functionalities. Once the authentication is done, the data sharing and communication are initiated for sharing the sensitive data. Thereafter the log file creation phase is initiated for storing the log entries. Then the attack detection is performed utilizing deep maxout network that is tuned by the developed gray wolf political optimizer (GWPO). The GWPO is the integration of gray wolf optimizer (GWO) and political optimizer (PO). Finally, attack mitigation is performed by reducing the data rates of attack nodes. The developed GWPO-enabled deep maxout network provided improved performance with the highest accuracy of 97.9\%, true positive rate of 97.3\%, and true negative rate of 97.7\%.},

	abstract = {Since the traffic conditions change over time, machine learning models that predict traffic flows must be updated continuously and efficiently in smart public transportation. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning scheme that allows buses to receive model updates without waiting for model training on the cloud. However, FL is vulnerable to poisoning or DDoS attacks since buses travel in public. Some work introduces blockchain to improve reliability, but the additional latency from the consensus process reduces the efficiency of FL. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) is a scheme that reduces the latency of aggregation to improve efficiency, but the learning performance is unstable due to unreasonably weighted local models. To address the above challenges, this paper offers a blockchain-based asynchronous federated learning scheme with a dynamic scaling factor (DBAFL). Specifically, the novel committee-based consensus algorithm for blockchain improves reliability at the lowest possible cost of time. Meanwhile, the devised dynamic scaling factor allows AFL to assign reasonable weights to stale local models. Extensive experiments conducted on heterogeneous devices validate outperformed learning performance, efficiency, and reliability of DBAFL.},

	abstract = {Spectrum detection plays an important role in SG communication and Internet of things (IoT) networks which is one of the core technologies in wireless communication network. The process of spectrum detection largely depends on energy sensing as this process needs to detect the energy of different frequency bands in the information transmission. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware scheme based on spectrum detection in wireless sensor networks applications, which can save the cost of data collection and computing power of DDoS attack detection without collecting a large number of traffic characteristics and large-scale deep learning model training. By detecting the information transmission energy in different frequency channels, the busy and idle state of the channel is judged. On the basis of the busy channel detection, the scope of DDoS attack is further judged by the topology of wireless sensor networks. Simulation results show that the proposed energy-aware algorithm can achieve the expected efficiency and accuracy, and is suitable for low load and high security requirements of wireless sensor networks.},

	abstract = {Server farms used in web hosting and commercial applications connect multiple servers. Edge computing being a realm of cloud technology is orchestrated with server farms to enhance network efficiency. Edge computing increases the availability of cloud resources and Internet services. The higher availability of services and their ease of access deeply affect the user's requesting behavior. The anomalous requesting behavior is creating malicious traffic, and enormous amount of such traffics at server farm denies the services to the legitimate users. Categorizing the incoming traffic into malicious and non-malicious traffic at server farm is the foremost criteria to eliminate the attacks, which in turn improves the QoS of the server farm. In the light of preventing the biased usage of the server farm, this paper proposes a SVM classifier based on requesting statistics. The proposed classifier discovers the attacks that deny services to legitimate users in two levels, based on the user's request behavior. The pattern of arrival, its statistical characteristics and security misbehaviors are investigated at both levels. An incremental learning algorithm is proposed to enhance the learning plasticity of the proposed classifier. The experimental results illustrate that the performance of the proposed two-level classifier with respect to classification accuracy is competently improved with incremental learning.},

Researchers can better understand the threats and weaknesses of the IoT if attacks are categorized to facilitate the development of a more robust defense system. This study discusses various attacks and statistical data related to IoT. These attacks are divided into two categories: physical and cyber-attacks. Based on the literature review, the authors found that social engineering and DoS are the most common attacks in the physical and cyber categories. This study demonstrates the security solutions inherent to securing the IoT environment. Cryptography, blockchain, software-defined networks, and machine learning techniques were reviewed. They also discussed steps that should be taken to make a safe IoT environment.},

	abstract = {The use of Machine Learning in many control and management processes is rising fast. This is especially true for the management of cloud native applications and for anomaly detection in cyber-security mechanisms. However, it has been shown that ML is an attack surface on its own, especially when the attack is performed by another ML system. Noting this issue, we develop a testbed infrastructure with Infrastructure-as-Code principles, designed to support research in the area of cloud services vulnerability to massive attacks from unsecure Internet of Things botnets with ML devised strategies. The infrastructure is modular and can support different malware to create botnets and use different algorithms in both the defensive and offensive sides, provided they use the available data or extend the data collection. We also present some results from a scenario where the defense uses an autoencoder for detecting anomalies in the traffic patterns of IoT devices and the attacker uses a Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm to penetrate this defense and induce resource waste on the cloud service behind it.},

	abstract = {Edge computing extends the traditional cloud computing architecture by using the computing and storage resources on the edge of the network, making people's work and life more convenient. However, these devices at the edge of the network are widely distributed and the environment is relatively complex. Attackers use these vulnerable IoT devices to build botnets to initiate distributed denial of service attacks, posing a serious threat to the normal use of such networks. In response to this problem, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on software-defined networking (SDN). The edge controller in the SDN network is used to obtain the flow information and extract the features of the flow. The XGBoost algorithm optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-XGBoost) we proposed is used to classify and detect the flow. Experimental results show that compared with other algorithms of the same type, our proposed algorithm has a lower false alarm rate and higher accuracy.},

	abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow, there arises concerns and challenges with regard to the security and privacy of the IoT. Malicious attacks such as man-in-the-middle and distributed denial of service (DDoS) are typical threats to the IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a FOg CompUting-based Security (FOCUS) system to provide security for IoT systems against those malicious attacks. The proposed FOCUS system applies a threefold protection mechanism: Firstly, it makes use of the virtual private network (VPN) to secure the communication channels for the IoT devices; Secondly, it applies machine learning-based traffic analysis unit to classify the traffic to be trusted, untrusted and suspicious; Thirdly, it adopts a challenge-response authentication to validate the suspicious traffic source so as to protect the VPN server against potential DDoS attacks. Such a threefold protection mechanism is effective in mitigating various malicious attacks and can provide a high standard security for the IoT system. Furthermore, to improve the system performance, FOCUS is implemented in a hybrid fog-cloud model that achieves a low latency and system response time. In the hybrid fog-cloud model, a selected amount of the protection and validation requests are addressed in the fog that is close to the end users, while the excessive requests are addressed in the cloud. Through this, FOCUS can effectively avoid the long queuing delay caused by the limited computational capacity in the fog implementation. The experimental results show that FOCUS can effectively filter out malicious attacks with low response time and small network cost (e.g., network bandwidth consumption).},

	abstract = {The digitalisation of finance influenced the emergence of new technological concepts for existing user needs. Financial technology, or fintech, provides improved services for customers and new economic value for businesses. As such, fintech services require on-demand availability on a 24/7 basis. For this reason, they are often deployed in cloud environments that allow connectivity with ubiquitous devices. This allows customers to perform online transactions, which are overseen by the respective financial institutions. However, such cloud-based systems introduce new challenges for information security. On one hand, they represent attractive targets for cyberattacks. On the other, financial frauds can still go unnoticed by the financial institutions in charge. This paper contributes to both challenges by introducing the concept for a cloud-based system architecture for fraud detection and client profiling in the banking domain. Therefore, a systematic risk assessment was conducted in this context, and exploitation probabilities were inferred for multiple attack scenarios. In addition, formal verification was accomplished in order to determine the effects of successful vulnerability exploits. The consequences of such security violations are discussed, and considerations are given for improving the resilience of fintech systems.},

	abstract = {IoT-Fog computing provides a wide range of services for end-based IoT systems. End IoT devices interface with cloud nodes and fog nodes to manage client tasks. Critical attacks like DDoS and other security risks are more likely to compromise IoT end devices while they are collecting data between the fog and the cloud layer. It's important to find these network vulnerabilities early. By extracting features and placing the danger in the network, DL is crucial in predicting end-user behavior. However, deep learning cannot be carried out on Internet of Things devices because to their constrained calculation and storage capabilities. In this research, we suggest a three-stage Deep Hybrid Detection Model for Attack Detection in IoT-Fog Architecture. Improved Z-score normalization-based data preparation will be carried out in the initial step. On the basis of preprocessed data, features like IG, raw data, entropy, and enhanced MI are extracted in the second step. The collected characteristics are used as input to hybrid classifiers dubbed optimized Deep Maxout and Deep Belief Network (DBN) in the third step of the process to classify the assaults based on the input dataset. A hybrid optimization model called the BMUJFO (Blue Monkey Updated Jellyfish Optimization) technique is presented for the best Deep Maxout training. Additionally, the suggested model produced higher accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity results, with values of 95.26 percent, 94.84\%, 96.28\%, and 97.84\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing environments, characterized by dynamic scaling, distributed architectures, and complex workloads, are increasingly targeted by malicious actors. These threats encompass unauthorized access, data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and evolving malware variants. Traditional security solutions often struggle with the dynamic nature of cloud environments, highlighting the need for robust Adaptive Cloud Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS). Existing adaptive CIDS solutions, while offering improved detection capabilities, often face limitations such as reliance on approximations for change point detection, hindering their precision in identifying anomalies. This can lead to missed attacks or an abundance of false alarms, impacting overall security effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ACIDS (Adaptive Cloud Intrusion Detection System)-PELT. This novel Adaptive CIDS framework leverages the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for enhanced accuracy and efficiency. ACIDS-PELT comprises four key components: (1) Feature Selection: Utilizing a hybrid harmony search algorithm and the symmetrical uncertainty filter (HSO-SU) to identify the most relevant features that effectively differentiate between normal and anomalous network traffic in the cloud environment. (2) Surveillance: Employing the PELT algorithm to detect change points within the network traffic data, enabling the identification of anomalies and potential security threats with improved precision compared to existing approaches. (3) Training Set: Labeled network traffic data forms the training set used to train the SVM classifier to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviour patterns. (4) Testing Set: The testing set evaluates ACIDS-PELT's performance by measuring its accuracy, precision, and recall in detecting security threats within the cloud environment. We evaluate the performance of ACIDS-PELT using the NSL-KDD benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate that ACIDS-PELT outperforms existing cloud intrusion detection techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. This superiority stems from ACIDS-PELT's ability to overcome limitations associated with approximation and imprecision in change point detection while offering a more accurate and precise approach to detecting security threats in dynamic cloud environments.},

	abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as an attractive and viable technique to provide effective solutions for a wide range of application domains. An important application domain is vehicular networks wherein ML-based approaches are found to be very useful to address various problems. The use of wireless communication between vehicular nodes and/or infrastructure makes it vulnerable to different types of attacks. In this regard, ML and its variants are gaining popularity to detect attacks and deal with different kinds of security issues in vehicular communication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of ML-based techniques for different security issues in vehicular networks. We first briefly introduce the basics of vehicular networks and different types of communications. Apart from the traditional vehicular networks, we also consider modern vehicular network architectures. We propose a taxonomy of security attacks in vehicular networks and discuss various security challenges and requirements. We classify the ML techniques developed in the literature according to their use in vehicular network applications. We explain the solution approaches and working principles of these ML techniques in addressing various security challenges and provide insightful discussion. The limitations and challenges in using ML-based methods in vehicular networks are discussed. Finally, we present observations and lessons learned before we conclude our work.},

	abstract = {Flash event generates enormous traffic and the cloud service providers use sustaining techniques like scaling and content delivery network to up their services. One of the main bottlenecks that the cloud service providers still find difficult to tackle is flash attacks. Illegitimate users send craftily designed packets to land up inside the server for wreaking havoc. As deep learning autoencoder has the potential to detect malicious traffic it has been used in this research study to develop an ensemble. Convolutional neural network is efficacious in overcoming the issue of overfitting; deep autoencoder is proficient in extracting features through dimensionality reduction. In order to obtain both these advantages it was decided to develop an ensemble keeping denoising autoencoder as the core element. The process of addressing a flash attack requires first detecting the presence of bot in malicious traffic, second studying its nature by observing its behavioral manifestations. Detection of botnet was achieved by three ensembles, namely, DAE\_CNN, DAE\_MLP, and DAE\_XGB. But capturing its external manifested behavior is challenging, because the bot signatures are always in a state of flux. The simulated empirical study yielded an appreciable outcome. Its accuracy rate was 99.9\% for all the three models and the false positive rates were 0, 0.006, and 0.001, respectively.},

	abstract = {Exploiting APIs by extrapolating out the vulnerabilities of a system is a trending issue for the cloud. The aftermath of API attacks includes sensitive data disclosure, misconfigured security parameters, broken authentication schemes, service disruption, financial loss, etc. Existing frameworks could handle a maximum of two issues in most cases (i.e., SQLIA, XSS attacks, malicious domain, DDoS attacks), and those solutions are not highly reliable. In contrast to them, we have pinpointed the security vulnerabilities of RESTful APIs in an accurate manner and presented a two-way approach to mitigate them. Moreover, we have also designed and implemented a reverse proxy that is capable of not only intercepting malicious attacks but also checking security properties upon creating or deleting resources which is an improved implementation of existing works. This system has been tested in a real cloud and our work has shown tremendous improvement in checking and mitigating SQL injection attacks, XSS attacks, and malicious domains over existing works. To check these three components, our framework consumes only 0.050298469 s (Average). Our system has also shown significant improvement in figuring out potential security rule violations (up to 48.90\% faster \& 47.82\% accurate than existing work). Furthermore, we have implemented a machine-learning model to improve the detectability of SQLI.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) as an emerging technology has metamorphized the use of smart devices, exchange of information and enhanced business processes in a ubiquitous and multi-faceted way. As Internet of Things (IoT) continues to gain tractable usage by billions of connected devices personal area network vulnerabilities, as identity and data theft, malware attacks and DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) have become prevalent. In this study, we investigate the use of Radio Frequency (RF) technology mitigating IoT vulnerabilities. Deployment of secure RF network that enhances interoperability of IoT Devices by allocating unique ID (signature) is evaluated. This study further explores clustering of heterogenous networks of IoT devices using an intelligent Radio Frequency model that identifies labels and anonymizes Radio Waves shared by IoT devices within electromagnetic field. This vulnerability mitigation process encompasses use of Machine learning and neural networks classification to cluster heterogenous IoT and networks shared by IoT devices. The use of unique ID for clustered heterogenous is simulated in this study as against foreign and unauthorized radio frequency threats to paired IoT devices in a shared network.},

	abstract = {With advances in mobile devices and systems and the emergence of new ideas such as cloud computing and big data, as well as the tremendous growth in the number of network users, the need to modify the current network architectures has been very much in the foreground in recent years. One of the promising solutions to overcome these challenges is software-defined networking (SDN). SDN is a unique innovative architecture in which network control and traffic flows are independent of each other and planned directly. The SDN's focused view of networks is more comprehensive than other methods, which is why SDN is more efficient in coping with malicious attacks including amplification attacks. The response to amplification of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is larger than the request. In an amplification attack, the attacker fakes the victim's address as the source address and the responses are forwarded to the victim instead of the attacker. This is why these attacks are more difficult to discover in traditional networks, while the focused method of SDN can contribute to the detection of such attacks. There are different methods for detecting these attacks, one of which is to use machine learning (ML) algorithms. In line with this, the present paper is aimed at the detection of distributed reflection denial of service (DRDoS) attacks using ML algorithms. Simulation was performed by the use of ML algorithms, and the findings suggest a significant improvement in the detection of DRDoS attacks in comparison with previous methods.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection in industrial control and cyber-physical systems has gained much attention over the past years due to the increasing modernisation and exposure of industrial environments. Current dangers to the connected industry include the theft of industrial intellectual property, denial of service, or the compromise of cloud components; all of which might result in a cyber-attack across the operational network. However, most scientific work employs device logs, which necessitate substantial understanding and preprocessing before they can be used in anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture based on a deep autoencoder trained on network flow data, which has the advantage of not requiring prior knowledge of the network topology or its underlying architecture. Experimental results show that the proposed model can detect anomalies, caused by distributed denial of service attacks, providing a high detection rate and low false alarms, outperforming the state-of-the-art and a baseline model in an unsupervised learning environment. Furthermore, the deep autoencoder model can detect abnormal behaviour in legitimate devices after an attack. We also demonstrate the suitability of the proposed NIDS in a real industrial plant from the alimentary sector, analysing the false positive rate and the viability of the data generation, filtering and preprocessing procedure for a near real time scenario. The suggested NIDS architecture is a low-cost solution that uses only fifteen network-based features, requires minimal processing, operates in unsupervised mode, and is straightforward to deploy in real-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing offers internet-based services to access various on-demand resources by overcoming the necessity of centralized computing. There are plenty of challenges, like privacy, security, load balancing, resource provisioning, existing in this virtualized environment. Among them, security is one of the major complications. Concerning the security and privacy issues, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks can cause great damage to the availability of cloud services and resources. Till now, attack mitigation strategies residues is an on-going research challenge due to the attack tendency to advance in sophistication and ease of implementation. Moreover, cloud service customers, as well as providers, need to be observant in understanding the menaces of DDoS attacks. The crux of such attack mitigation mechanism is to assure early and fast detection of illegitimate entries into the network. To address such monitoring and detecting mechanism, this paper aims to address various nature-inspired algorithms which are having the propensity to resolve malware issues, such as DDoS attacks, naturally by offering an optimized solution.},

We apply Snort-IDS with a combination of Splunk web framework (tool for visualization) to detect and prevent DDOS/DOS attacks based on signature rules. Moreover, to be able to mitigate known/unknown cloud attacks, anomaly detection approach is built using Genetic Algorithm. We deeply analyse, explore the existing Snort-IDS rules for DDOS/DOS attacks, and provide some improvement on the evaluated Snort-IDS rules. Through the analysis of the experimental results, we conclude that our approach could be incorporated in cloud service models to reduce these attacks.},

	abstract = {In a distributed cloud context, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are widespread. The services are rendered unavailable to legitimate users as a result of the overwhelming traffic, resulting in financial losses. There are possible obstacles, although several researchers have established various mitigation measures. Initially, Software-defined networking technology was revealed to protect businesses from DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks cause server outages and financial losses due to service unavailability. Meeting of service-level agreement with the customers remains a challenge. In this article, the scattered denial-of-service mitigation tree architecture (SDMTA) is used to propose a novel DDoS mitigation strategy for the hybrid cloud environment. To enable detection procedures, the proposed SDMTA mitigation architecture includes integrated network monitoring. The suggested and existing state-of-the-art models' detection rates over the input dataset were estimated. When compared to the existing state-of-the-art model, the system's accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity were found to be 99.7\%, 98.32\%, and 99.92\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {DDoS attacks are a type of cloud incursion that lessen service degradation. DDoS attacks target the cloud network with invalid requests, rejecting legitimate requests. Such attacks disrupt the entire cloud architecture, thus it needs efficient detection methods to spot their presence. This study proposes a novel ensemble classification model for DDoS incursion detection. Pre-processing, feature extraction, and attack detection are the three main components of the suggested intrusion detection system. Improved data imbalance processing is processed during pre-processing. Features including HOS-based features enhanced entropy-based features, correlation features, and raw features are extracted from the pre-processed data. The generated features are trained using an ensemble model, which integrates classifiers like SVM, RF, NN, LSTM, and DRN, during the attack detection phase. A new hybrid approach known as TUDMA optimally trains the model by setting the ideal weight because DRN provides the final detected outcome. By reducing errors, this ideal training will guarantee an improvement in detection results. The suggested hybrid optimization combines the two techniques, TDO and DMO. The accuracy of the methods FS-WOA-DNN, RBF-PSO, SMA, BRO, SLO, and NMRA was 86.73\%, 85.69\%, 84.58\%, 87.43\%, 88.91\%, and 89.78\%, respectively, while the accuracy of the TUDMA was 95.34\% in the 80th learning percentage. Finally, for many measurements, the suggested efficiency is superior to the traditional methods.},

	abstract = {Leveraging cloud computing resources and previews in intelligent transportation systems to improve electric city buses (ECBs) energy system performance is an emerging topic. However, internet connectivity will expose the ECB to cyberattacks, which will cause service interruption and downstream financial implications. In this study, detection and protection systems are designed under a proposed architecture for ECBs with Vehicle-to-Cloud connectivity to address the denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. The analysis conducted in this article shows that the distributed DDoS attack is most crucial because it is easy to be launched and hard to be defended. By overwhelming traffics with spam, DDoS attacks can easily cut off the vehicle connection to cloud servers and disable all (compromised and surviving) ECBs that rely on vehicle-to-cloud connectivity. The simulation results indicate that, even though 99.9\% of ECBs in the system are compromised and converted to attacking sources, with the proposed security systems in the cloud, the blocking probability between servers and surviving filed devices is kept below 28.08\%. Besides, for a surviving field device protected by the proposed approach, harsh DDoS attacks only degrade the energy efficiency and battery life performance of the tested energy management system by 0.2288\% when compared to the benchmark results.},

	abstract = {Edge computing has become a fundamental technology for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. To provide reliable services for latency-sensitive applications, edge servers must respond to end devices within the shortest amount of time possible. Edge distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which render edge servers unusable by legitimate IoT applications by sending heavy requests from distributed attacking sources, is a threat that leads to severe latency. To protect edge servers from DDoS attacks, a hybrid computing paradigm known as an end-edge-cloud ecosystem provides a possible solution. Cloud assistance is allowed with this architecture. Edge servers can upload their pending tasks onto a cloud center for a workload reduction when encountering a DDoS attack, similar to borrowing resources from the cloud. Nevertheless, before using the ecosystem to mitigate edge DDoS attacks, we must address the core problem that edge servers must decide when and to what extent they should upload tasks to the cloud center. In this study, we focus on the design of optimal cloud assistance policies. First, we propose an edge workload evolution model that describes how the workload of the edge servers change over time with a given cloud assistance policy. On this basis, we quantify the effectiveness of the policy by using the resulting overall latency and formulate an optimal control problem for seeking optimal policies that can minimize such latency. We then provide solutions by deriving the optimality system and discuss some properties of the optimal solutions to accelerate the problem solving. Next, we introduce a numerical iterative algorithm to seek solutions that can satisfy the optimality system. Finally, we provide several illustrative numerical examples. The results show that the optimal policies obtained can effectively mitigate edge DDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {The biggest firms throughout the world now are the ones that offer services in the cloud. One of the top problems for cloud users (CUs) and cloud service providers (CSPs) is the availability of cloud-based services whenever needed. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) assault has been a significant threat to the security of the system in recent years. DDoS defense and detection of these attacks have become hot topics of research for academia and business. However, most approaches cannot accomplish efficient detection outcomes with few false alarms. As a result, minimizing the consequences of DDoS attacks allows CSPs to offer CUs high-quality services. In the cloud sector, a collective deep structured algorithm is suggested to identify DDoS attacks successfully. The recommended method contains several stages: data acquisition, pre-processing, optimal feature detection, and selection. The first step is the acquisition of data using the help of publicly available sources. Further, the input data undergoes preprocessing. Consequently, the optimal weighted feature selection takes place on the preprocessed data, where the optimization is done with the aid of the Hybrid Border Collie and Dragonfly Algorithm (HBCDA). Finally, DDoS attack detection is achieved via a novel method known as adaptive deep dilated ensemble (ADDE), which includes, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN), deep temporal convolutional neural network (DTCNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). For the attainment of optimal results, the parameter tuning is accomplished by using the HBCDA approach. The detection outcome is computed by using the fuzzy ranking mechanism. The validation is done for the suggested method model, and its corresponding findings are validated with conventional techniques. Hence, the suggested approach outperforms the detection performance and ensures more efficiency than traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {As explosive development of the 5th generation wireless systems (5 G), the traces of botnet could be found in a cellular phone, intelligent equipment, cloud, and even Bitcoin network. Hackers are then able to launch the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack via mastering these vulnerable devices. No doubt that the enterprise and government must suffer from the tremendous loss once specific services cannot function normally due to the DDoS. Inspired by a counterintuitive thinking, we actively predict a variant of hybrid botnet based on social network. The addressed prototype, resurrection social hybrid botnet (RSHB), could offer cyber researcher to formulate corresponding defense strategy against botnet. According to comprehensive simulations, the survivability has demonstrated that RSHB is much more dangerous than other botnets. Consequently, RSHB might be a coming sample for cyber engineer to explore the defense methodology. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is the technology that is currently used to provide users with infrastructure, platform, and software services effectively. Under this system, Platform as a Service (PaaS) offers a medium headed for a web development platform that uniformly distributes the requests and resources. Hackers using Denial of service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks abruptly interrupt these requests. Even though several existing methods like signature-based, statistical anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis are available, they are not sufficient enough to get rid of Denial of service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and hence there is a great need for a definite algorithm. Concerning this issue, we propose an improved hybrid algorithm which is a combination of Multivariate correlation analysis, Spearman coefficient, and mitigation technique. It can easily differentiate common traffic and attack traffic. Not only that, it greatly helps the network to distribute the resources only for authenticated requests. The effects of comparing with the normalized information have shown an extra encouraging detection accuracy of 99\% for the numerous DoS attack as well as DDoS attacks.},

	journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

	pages = {74641-74656},
	abstract = {Memory Denial of Service (M-DoS) attacks refer to a class of cyber-attacks that aim to exhaust the memory resources of a system, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users. This type of attack is particularly dangerous in cloud computing environments, where multiple users share the same resources. Detection and mitigation of M-DoS attacks in real-time is a challenging task, as they often involve a large number of low-rate requests, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate traffic. Several real-time detection schemes have been proposed to identify and mitigate M-DoS attacks in cloud computing environments. These schemes can be broadly classified into two categories: signature-based and anomaly-based detection. Signature-based detection methods rely on the identification of specific patterns or characteristics of known M-DoS attack techniques, while anomaly-based detection methods identify abnormal behaviour that deviates from the normal pattern of usage. This study presents a hybrid model for real-time detection of cloud and MDOS attacks using SVM-KNN-LR. The dataset used in this study was collected from various sources and pre-processed to extract relevant features for attack detection. A feature selection process was also applied to identify the most important features for attack detection. The hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 96\%, outperforming other individual models such as SVM, KNN, LR, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Bagging Trees, and Random Forests. Confusion matrices were also used to evaluate the performance of each model. In the discussion section, we examined the performance of the hybrid model in detecting MDOS attacks and found that it had a high precision score of 0.97. However, the recall score was lower at 0.87, indicating that the model was not able to detect all instances of MDOS attacks.},

This paper presents a robust security scheme to provide fortification against major threats along with user privacy in 5G network, two additional entities are introduced. For mobile users, initial authentication is provided at access points by an inventive Highly Secured Authentication and Handover Mechanism (HS-AOHM) scheme which minimizes handover latency without loss of user privacy. Then the authorized user packets are arrived at dispatcher in which a novel Tree Based Switch Assignment (TBSA) algorithm is incorporated. TBSA mitigates the flow table overloading attack by assigning packets to underloaded switches. In controller, DDoS attack is detected with the assist of entropy analysis. Then the suspicious packets are redirected to scrubbing Virtual Network Function (sVNF) in cloud. In sVNF, suspicious packets are classified into normal packets and malicious packets by using Hybrid Fuzzy with Artificial Neural Network (HF-ANN) classifier based on packet features. Normal packets are allowed to access applications whereas malicious packets are dropped at sVNF. Extensive simulation shows security improvement in 5G network in terms of handover latency, holding time, switch failure rate, detection accuracy, and delay.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming truly ubiquitous in every domain of human lives, and a large number of objects can be connected and enabled to communicate with cloud servers at any time. However, complex connections and vulnerabilities of IoT devices introduce inevitable security threats, in which distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks usually incur catastrophic results. Unfortunately, the existing DDoS mitigation methods cannot provide effective protection. Moreover, the amplifying complexity and increasing delay incurred by defense greatly affect the stability of IoT networks. To tackle these problems, we present a novel framework that can proactively adapt the attack surface of IoT networks, dynamically optimize defense strategies, and rapidly deploy the corresponding defense mechanisms. In particular, we establish hybrid proactive defense mechanisms combining Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques with cyber deception to spread camouflage information to confuse attackers. Based on these mechanisms, we introduce a defender-led signaling game model to formalize defense scenarios and depict the interactions between the defender and the attacker. Besides, we present an optimal algorithm to solve decision problems and optimize defense implementation in a cost-effective manner. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively mitigate DDoS attacks and maintain a high level of performance in IoT networks with acceptable overhead.},

	abstract = {Detection of Denial of Service (DoS) attack is one of the most critical issues in cloud computing. The attack detection framework is very complex due to the nonlinear thought of interruption activities, unusual conduct of systems traffic, and many attributes in the issue space. This paper proposes an efficient DoS attack detection system that uses the Oppositional Crow Search Algorithm (OCSA), which integrates the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) and Opposition Based Learning (OBL) method to address such type of issues. The proposed system consists of two stages viz. selection of features using OCSA and classification using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classifier. The essential features are selected using the OCSA algorithm and then given to RNN classifier. In the subsequent testing process, incoming data is classified using the RNN classifier. It ensures the separation of standard data (saved in cloud) and the removal of compromised data Using the benchmark data set, the results of experimental evaluation demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the other conventional methods by 98.18\%, 95.13\%, 93.56\%, and 94.12\% in terms of Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and Accuracy respectively. Further, the proposed work outperforms existing works by 3\% on an average for all the metrics used. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, cloud computing has been widely used in various fields and is gaining importance in healthcare systems. Patients' health data are outsourced to cloud storage, enabling healthcare professionals to easily access health information from anywhere and at any time to improve health services. Once patient data are stored in the cloud, they are vulnerable to attacks such as data loss, denial of service (DoS), distributed denial of service (DDoS) and other sorts of cyberattacks. Data confidentiality and patient privacy are more of a problem in the cloud computing context due to their public availability. If a patient's personal information is stolen, he or she may face a range of problems. These are concerns that necessitate more security. The transmission of this sensitive information over the internet is always susceptible to hacking. Therefore, the privacy of patients' data is considered one of healthcare organizations' main issues. To overcome this problem, encryption mechanisms that place a significant emphasis on securing data within the cloud environment are used to preserve sensitive health data. A hybrid cryptography approach is employed in this paper to ensure the secure sharing of health data over the cloud. To maintain data privacy and secrecy, a hybrid cryptography mechanism for storing and transporting data to and from the cloud is used. To protect data from malevolent insiders, the encryption key is separated into two halves, controlling access to patient records via a specific technique. This paper shows the implementation and performance evaluation of the proposal as a functional system prototype. The evaluation is based on the key generation time, the record encryption time, the record decryption time, the record upload time and the record download time for different user numbers and different file sizes varying from 0.1 MB to 500 MB. The findings show that data in cloud environments.},

	abstract = {Web crawlers collect and index the vast amount of data available online to gather specific types of objective data such as news that researchers or practitioners need. As big data are increasingly used in a variety of fields and web data are exponentially growing each year, the importance of web crawlers is growing as well. Web servers that currently handle high traffic, such as portal news servers, have safeguards against security threats such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In particular, the crawler, which causes a large amount of traffic to the Web server, has a very similar nature to DDoS attacks, so the crawler's activities tend to be blocked from the web server. A peer-to-peer (P2P) crawler can be used to solve these problems. However, the limitations with the pure P2P crawler is that it is difficult to maintain the entire system when network traffic increases or errors occur. Therefore, in order to overcome these limitations, we would like to propose a hybrid P2P crawler that can collect web data using the cloud service platform provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The hybrid P2P networking distributed web crawler using AWS (HP2PNC-AWS) is applied to collecting news on Korea's current smart work lifestyle from three portal sites. In Portal A where the target server does not block crawling, the HP2PNC-AWS is faster than the general web crawler (GWC) and slightly slower than the server/client distributed web crawler (SC-DWC), but it has a similar performance to the SC-DWC. However, in both Portal B and C where the target server blocks crawling, the HP2PNC-AWS performs better than other methods, with the collection rate and the number of data collected at the same time. It was also confirmed that the hybrid P2P networking system could work efficiently in web crawler architectures.},

	abstract = {With the development of cloud computing technology (CCT), the processing of network traffic data becomes particularly important. However, the existing intrusion detection systems (IDS) are not efficient enough in analyzing network traffic data for anomaly detection. Therefore, this paper proposes a new data processing model for network anomaly detection. The model can simultaneously optimize the number of features (NF), accuracy, recall, false alarm rate (FAR) and precision. In order to better solve the model, an integrating dominance algorithm (MaOEA-ABC) with adaptive selection probability is proposed. In model, firstly, MaOEA-ABC is used to obtain the optimal feature subset by optimizing the above five objectives. Then, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is used for network anomaly classification according to the optimal feature subset. Finally, MaOEA-ABC is compared with the existing standard MaOEAs algorithm (NSGA-III, EFR-RR, MaOEA-RD and PICEAg). The experimental results show that the approach can reduce the number of features on the basis of ensuring accuracy and FAR, thereby reducing the cost of detection.},

	abstract = {Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) provides high network bandwidth and ultra-low latency response time but also inherits the security vulnerabilities of cloud computing to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. To guard MEC nodes from such attacks, previous work has proposed the use of Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDS) as a prime candidate for attack detection. Our previous work looked at Centralised and Distributed CIDS architectures and identified some shortcomings in them. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by presenting a purely edge-based novel Hybrid CIDS architecture, and its improvement using an exponential threshold mechanism. We assess the performance of our novel architectures through experimentation on a real-world worm dataset based on detection accuracy, bandwidth utilisation, and CPU and memory usage, and compare against benchmark performance results for the Centralised and the Distributed CIDS architectures proposed previously. Following this, we present the performance metrics of our novel architectures during node failure events and outline their resilience to such failures.},

	abstract = {In the reliability and security challenges for the Internet of Things (IoT) systems, managing unpredictable events and controlling the abnormal situation automatically are provisioned by the integration of self-healing properties. Despite this, in our knowledge, this integration is not used to repair from malicious behaviors and potential distributed denial of service (DDoS) device attacks, especially in a collaborative way to maximize the quality of service parameters (availability). For that, we propose a diagnosable distributed protocol, in a hybrid-IoT system designed based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) for IoT middleware in the things-oriented vision. The proposed protocol identifies and re-locates the denied service using the contextual recovery or the Sensing as a Service model (S(2)aaS) in the Cloud-IoT platform, as a backup to ensure the service availability. On the basis of this idea, this paper defines the system states under self-healing (in collaboration state) and self-protection autonomic-control loops. Besides, the closure (safety) and the convergence (liveness) properties will be defined and proved satisfied by the proposed protocol. Furthermore, to highlight the interest of the protocol, we present an application in the context of the smart-building (Lab) as an IoT solution.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) environment has become the basic channel for the propagation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and malware intrusions. Cyber threats in IoT require new mechanisms and strategies to secure devices during their life cycle. These threats are real for operators and manufacturers of connected objects. Less and uncorrected secure devices are priority objectives for botnet operators to capture and obtain testing devices. In this article, we reviewed the problem of optimizing the placement of security components in IoT. We provide a generic view of the placement of security components at different levels in the IoT. First, we present an overview of IoT. Then, we conduct a demonstration and a thematic classification of numerous solutions for the placement of security components in the IoT. Thus, this presentation will be followed by a discussion of diverse research questions and a set of proposals for various future orientations of this domain to advance the problem resolution in this research article.},

	abstract = {The last decade consolidated the cyberspace as fifth domain of military operations, which extends its preliminarily intelligence and information exchange purposes towards enabling complex offensive and defensive operations supported/supportively of parallel kinetic domain actuations. Although there is a plethora of well documented cases on strategic and operational interventions of cyber commands, the cyber tactical military edge is still a challenge, where cyber fires barely integrate to the traditional joint targeting cycle due to, among others, long planning/development times, asymmetric effects, strict target reachability requirements, or the fast propagation of collateral damage; the latter rapidly deriving on hybrid impacts (political, economic, social, etc.) and evidencing significant socio-technical gaps. In this context, it is expected that Tactical Clouds disruptively facilitate cyber operations at the edge while exposing the rest of the digital assets of the operation to them. On these grounds, the main purpose of the conducted research is to review and in depth analyze the risks and opportunities of jeopardizing the sustainability of the military Tactical Clouds at their cyber edge. Along with a 1) comprehensively formulation of the researched problematic, the study 2) formalizes the Tactical Denial of Sustainability (TDoS) concept; 3) introduces the phasing, potential attack surfaces, terrains and impact of TDoS attacks; 4) emphasizes the related human and socio-technical aspects; 5) analyzes the threats/opportunities inherent to their impact on the cloud energy efficiency; 6) reviews their implications at the military cyber thinking for tactical operations; 7) illustrates five extensive CONOPS that facilitate the understanding of the TDoS concept; and given the high novelty of the discussed topics, this paper 8) paves the way for further research and development actions.

	abstract = {Cloud services are the major target for malicious attacks as more organizations and individuals shift to the cloud. When DDoS assaults pose one of the most significant dangers to Internet users and cloud services, this is especially important. As a result of DDoS assaults, cloud services cannot transmit optimum network infrastructure and sensitive information. Due to the flexibility of cloud computing, DDoS mitigation techniques in the cloud are significantly different from those used in conventional networks. When it comes to DDoS assaults, this article examines their influence on cloud resources and proposes a realistic intrusion detection system (IDS) referred to as DDoSNet. To evaluate models, this research study utilizes the CICIDS 2017 dataset. The intelligence approach of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied for feature selection. The optimal features are given input to the deep neural network (DNN) model to classify the given data as malicious or benign. The accuracy rate, recall, precision, and F1-score metrics are considered for model evaluation. The experimental results show an accuracy of 099.81%, precision of 099.77%, recall of 099.89% & F1 score of 099.83%. The presented system outperforms the conventional machine learning models. Hence, this model imparts huge confidence in providing security to cloud services. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a 5G-enabling solution that aims to bring cloud-computing capabilities closer to the end-users. This paper focuses on mitigation techniques against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in the context of 5G MEC, providing solutions that involve the virtualized environment and the management entities from the MEC architecture. The proposed solutions are an extension of the study carried out in [5] and aim to reduce the risk of affecting legitimate traffic in the context of DDoS attacks. Our work supports the idea of using a network flow collector that sends the data to an anomaly detection system based on artificial intelligence techniques and, as an improvement over the previous work, it contributes to redirecting detected anomalies for isolation to a separate virtual machine. This virtual machine uses deep packet inspection tools to analyze the traffic and provides services until the final verdict. We decrease the risk of compromising the virtual machine that provides services to legitimate users by isolating the suspicious traffic. The management entities of the MEC architecture allow to re-instantiate or reconfigure the virtual machines. Hence, if the machine inspecting the isolated traffic crashes because of an attack, the damaged machine can be restored while the services provided to legitimate users are not affected. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In the context of future networking technologies, Software-Defined paradigm offers compelling solutions and advantages for traffic orchestration and shaping, flexible and dynamic routing, programmable control and smart application-driven resource management. But the SDN operation has to confront critical issues and technical vulnerabilities, security problems and threats in the enabling technical architecture itself. To address the critical security problems in SDN enabled data centers, we propose a collaborative “Network Security and Intrusion Detection System(NIDS)” scheme called ‘VARMAN: adVanced multi-plAne secuRity fraMework for softwAre defined Networks’. The SDN security scheme comprises of coarse-grained flow monitoring algorithms on the dataplane for rapid anomaly detection and prediction of network-centric DDoS/botnet attacks. In addition, this is combined with a fine-grained hybrid deep-learning based classifier pipeline on the control plane. It is observed that existing ML-based classifiers improve the accuracy of NIDS, however, at the cost of higher processing power and memory requirement, thus unrealistic for real-time solutions. To address these problems and still achieve accuracy and speed, we designed a hybrid model, combining both deep and shallow learning techniques, that are implemented in an improved SDN stack. The data plane deploys attack prediction and behavioral trigger mechanisms, efficient data filtering, feature selection, and data reduction techniques. To demonstrate the practical feasibility of our security scheme in real modern datacenters, we utilized the popular NSL-KDD dataset, most recent CICIDS2017 dataset, and refined it to a balanced dataset containing a comparable number of normal traffic and malware samples. We further augmented the training by organically generating datasets from lab-simulated and public-network hosted hackathon websites. The results show that VARMAN framework is capable of detecting attacks in real-time with accuracy more than 98% under attack intensities up to 50k packets/second. In a multi-controller interconnected SDN domain, the flow setup time improves by 70% on an average, and controller response time reduces by 40%, without incurring additional latency due to security intelligence processing overhead in SDN stack.

	abstract = {Almost over 4 billion people are currently making rampant usage of the internet. The massive utilization of mobile technology along with the rise of the digital era caused a socio-technical threat to the Government and to the public. Many new developments in the internet and modern technologies give rise to new illegal and unethical opportunities among which some of them are crime. Cyber crime is an unlawful means which makes use of a digital media either as a tool or as a target or both. Cyber crime cases, which includes mainly the Phishing attacks and many other attacks in the prevailing COVID -19 situation, have reached an alarming rate with the outburst of numerous forms of crime. This paper focuses on various types of cyber crime and targets some of the present day cyber crime attacks based on Phishing, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud technology and Block chain. The principal objective of this work is to identify how Machine Learning can be deployed in detection of diversified fields of cyber crime. The application of various Machine Learning models in the prediction, identification and mitigation of complex threats is also discussed. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolutionary expandable network which has brought many advantages, improving the Quality of Life (QoL) of individuals. However, IoT carries dangers, due to the fact that hackers have the ability to find security gaps in users' IoT devices, which are not still secure enough and hence, intrude into them for malicious activities. As a result, they can control many connected devices in an IoT network, turning IoT into Botnet of Things (BoT). In a botnet, hackers can launch several types of attacks, such as the well known attacks of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Man in the Middle (MitM), and/or spread various types of malicious software (malware) to the compromised devices of the IoT network. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered honeynet for enhanced IoT botnet detection rate with the use of Cloud Computing (CC). This upcoming security mechanism makes use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques like the Logistic Regression (LR) in order to predict potential botnet existence. It can also be adopted by other conventional security architectures in order to intercept hackers the creation of large botnets for malicious actions. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a mathematical model that serves as the basis for determining sets of solutions for fully connected networks without loop flows with three or four nodes. Based on these solutions, software was developed to calculate the statistical distribution of entropy values within the network. The statistical properties of information flow entropy in networks, with or without restrictions allowing uniform flow distribution, are analyzed. This characteristic is of practical importance for analyzing the dynamic state of the network and predicting flow redistribution processes from an initial unbalanced position, which inherently leads to increasing entropy. Another practical application of these results is their use as a foundation for algorithms to detect network imbalances resulting from significant external influences without causing a substantial change in the total network load. This may include concealed DDoS attacks that replace useful network traffic in order to reduce bandwidth. The analysis method developed in this work can be adapted for networks with different topological structures, as the maj ority of networks do not have full connectivity or are generally loosely connected networks. The importance of this method is also on the rise due to the increased computing power available through cloud computing technologies and the accumulation of statistics on information flow distribution in networks for various purposes. This way, the network analysis technique discussed here can be implemented with the assistance of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of the Internet has brought great convenience to our life, especially with the Internet of things, big data, and cloud computing with the advent of the era of artificial intelligence, all connected everywhere in people's lives, but at the same time in the information age, is faced with a growing number of network information security problems, especially the attacker can use ranged attack system, As the defense system and detection method of layer DDoS become more and more perfect, the attackers turn to the more covert application layer. Because of the powerful information extraction ability and classification performance of machine learning on data, more and more scientists have introduced machine learning into intrusion detection research. In this paper, an intrusion detection model based on LSTM and random forests is proposed. First, LSTM is used to classify the data set into two categories, and then the normal data and attack data are divided and abnormal attacks are identified. Then, the random forests algorithm is used to classify the abnormal data and identify specific attack types. The experimental results on the CIC DOS Dataset (2017) show that the LSTM model used in this paper can detect the attack data with a high probability, which achieves the primary purpose of detecting the network attack data, and the multi-classification random forests model used can also achieve a good recognition effect for the attack categories with fewer samples in the dataset. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Now it became imperative to secure our IoT Networks or to reduce them from cyberattacks in the form of Botnet Malware or any other malware through Machine Learning (ML) concepts or techniques. Machine Learning has played a major role in the detection of IoT botnet attacks. Most technology, including Machine Learning and Deep Learning, has been incorporated in some form or another from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing, and even IoT in terms of IoT network security and how we will assess and enhance network performance.

However, securing cloud services against vulnerabilities, threats, and modern attacks remains a major concern. Application layer attacks are particularly problematic because they can cause significant damage and are often difficult to detect, as malicious traffic can be indistinguishable from normal traffic flows. Moreover, preventing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is challenging due to its high impact on physical computer resources and network bandwidth. This study examines new variations of DDoS attacks within the broader context of cyber threats and utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches to detect and prevent such modern attacks. The conducted investigation determines that the current detection methods predominantly employ collectively, hybrid, and single Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Further, the analysis of diverse DDoS attacks and their related defensive strategies is vital in safeguarding cloud infrastructure against the detrimental consequences of DDoS attacks. This article offers a comprehensive classification of the various types of cloud DDoS attacks, along with an in-depth analysis of the characterization, detection, prevention, and mitigation strategies employed. The article presents, an in-depth analysis of crucial performance measures used to assess different defence systems and their effectiveness in a cloud computing environment. This article aims to encourage cloud security researchers to devise efficient defence strategies against diverse DDoS attacks. The survey identifies and elucidates the research gaps and obstacles, while also providing an overview of potential future research areas. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have a negative impact on service availability and service providers, as well as on the economy. They lead to difficulty in the provision of online services because most or all the service providers use resources, and the bandwidth becomes completely depleted due to the lack of resources to perform the basic functions required in service delivery platforms. Because this kind of attack is unconventional, the detection process demands more complex methods and algorithms. Based on several algorithms such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine algorithms, in this study we supplied an ideal model for the detection of the attack. We used a training dataset that had been built from the known and suspicious traffic dataset for learning using different classification algorithms to make a prediction model to be utilized as a reference for the unknown traffic classification. To make sure we choose the best prediction model, we performed a validation for the prediction model by applying the prediction model to a test dataset, generating a confusion matrix, and utilizing it to obtain the maximum prediction probability and minimum false alarm rate. By using the prediction model, we can detect the attack traffic, get the necessary data about attacking botnet and forward this information to a firewall to block suspicious traffic and stop the attack. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The goal of DDoS is to impede the availability of network-connected systems. They generate excessive traffic to the targeted servers will deplete the computational and communication resources.

Intelligence technique incorporated into the architecture gives massive tangible and intangible benefits in terms of performance and reliability. Such cloud-based business architecture faces many threats towards its availability. DDoS attack is the most prominent threat as its impact is more in the virtual resource-based cloud infrastructure. Therefore, there is a need for a business intelligence-based framework to detect early the attack by monitoring the virtual network traffic. The proposed intelligence framework uses a deep learning framework, continuous discriminative-deep belief network (CD-DBN). CD-DBN dynamically captures attack patterns from the network data, analyses the data and detects the intrusion to the cloud. The observed result shows that the earlier detection approach guarantees the availability of cloud services to the legitimate users and enhances the cloud resource usage.

	abstract = {As the frequency of security breaches continues to rise, cybersecurity remains a critical concern for every industry in the online. Thousands of zeroday attacks are known to emerge on a regular basis as a consequence of the integration of multiple protocols, primarily from the Internet of Things (IoT). The majority of such attacks are minor variants on previous research findings intrusions. This suggests that even sophisticated techniques like typical machine learning (ML) algorithms have difficulties spotting these tiny kinds of attacks over time. These attacks are called as DDoS attack; they are used to prevent clients from accessing a server or website. DDoS attacks have been employed by cybercriminals to bring down targeted servers and breach venture networks with the ability to overwhelm results. Because of the growing volume and complexity of DDoS attacks, many organizations are having difficulty handling them. Smart gadgets and IoT are particularly vulnerable to a wide range of DDoS hits due to resource constraints such as limited memory and processing capacity, thus cybercriminals are aware of these current technologies and their flaws. Because of an attack on their internet service providers in 2016, many firms, including Netflix, CNN, and Twitter, were forced to go down for nine hours. This technological failure resulted in several issues, including financial losses, productivity losses, brand damage, insurance rating drops, unstable client-provider relationships, and IT budget overruns. We need to construct an IDS system to expose and prevent DDoS attacks to secure data processing, information technology, and commercial components. The cost of cybersecurity will be greatly lowered if security teams use current and new technology like ML, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI). This study will examine the detection performance of DDoS attacks using several ML, DL techniques and also categorize it into cloud and fog ecosystems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The explosive development of information technology is increasingly rising cyber-attacks. Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a malicious threat to the modern cyber-security world, which causes performance disruption to the network servers. It is a pernicious type of attack that can forward a large amount of traffic to damage one or all target’s resources simultaneously and prevents authenticated users from accessing network services. The paper aims to select the least number of relevant DDoS attack detection features by designing an intelligent wrapper feature selection model that utilizes a binary-particle swarm optimization algorithm with a decision tree classifier. In this paper, the Binary-particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to resolve discrete optimization problems such as feature selection and decision tree classifier as a performance evaluator to evaluate the wrapper model’s accuracy using the selected features from the network traffic flows. The model’s intelligence is indicated by selecting 19 convenient features out of 76 features of the dataset. The experiments were accomplished on a large DDoS dataset. The optimal selected features were evaluated with different machine learning algorithms by performance measurement metrics regarding the accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1-score to detect DDoS attacks. The proposed model showed a high accuracy rate by decision tree classifier 99.52%, random forest 96.94%, and multi-layer perceptron 90.06 %. Also, the paper compares the outcome of the proposed model with previous feature selection models in terms of performance measurement metrics. This outcome will be useful for improving DDoS attack detection systems based on machine learning algorithms. It is also probably applied to other research topics such as DDoS attack detection in the cloud environment and DDoS attack mitigation systems. © 2021, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

	abstract = {A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is an attack which aim is to stop or tamper with an online service incapacitating a server with a flood of packages or requests, using internet or intranet. The main aim of the DDoS attack is to collapse the network or server with abnormal traffic to make the service unavailable for the legitimate users. This problem is particularly profound, due to the development of emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things or artificial intelligence techniques, from which attackers can take advantage by launching a huge volume of DDoS attacks at a lower cost, and it is much harder to detect and prevent DDoS attacks, because DDoS traffic is similar to normal traffic. In this paper we implement a novel technique implementing an unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based algorithm. Using a real traffic dataset, the CIC-DDoS2019, for benchmark, the proposed GMM can achieve recall, precision, and accuracy up to 99%. Experiments reveal that this can be a promising solution for the detection of DDoS attacks. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

In recent years, network traffic attacks on enterprise servers have been particularly serious. The emergence of SDN brings new solutions to the traffic detection of traditional networks, and domestic and foreign scholars combine the popular artificial intelligence algorithms to conduct research and modeling. Although the model based on machine learning can detect attacks to a certain extent, the applicability shows relatively poorly. This paper proposes a hybrid detection mechanism for DDoS attack: an abnormal traffic discovery way based on information entropy XGBoost model, called EXBM, and builds SDN environment to verify its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of this scheme is improved compared with other algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.},

The existing anomaly detection methods are all aimed at the research of known attacks, and there is not much progress on the research of some unknown attacks and workload peaks of cloud platforms. In order to deal with the unknown attack of the cloud platform and distinguish the behavior after the attack from the peak load under normal work, this paper studies a cloud data center anomaly detection method for Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks. We built a virtual machine cluster on openstack, simulated DDoS attacks on virtual machines, collected CPU utilization and network traffic data before and after the attack, and performed anomaly detection and analysis through a single class classification algorithm and analysis of time window sequences. We evaluated the performance of this method through lab-based experiments and real-world cloud data center experiments. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Instead of storing data on a hard drive, cloud computing is seen as the best option. The Internet is used to deliver three different kinds of computing services to users all over the world. One advantage that cloud computing provides to its customers is greater access to resources and higher performance while at the same time increasing the risk of an attack. Intrusion detection systems that can handle a large volume of data packets, analyse them, and generate reports based on knowledge and behaviour analysis were developed as part of this research. As an added layer of protection, the Convolution Neural Network Algorithm is used to encrypt data during end-to-end transmission and to store it in the cloud. Intrusion detection increases the safety of data in the cloud. In this paper demonstrates the data is encrypted and decrypted using a model of an algorithm and explains how it is protected from attackers. It's important to take into account the amount of time and memory required to encrypt and decrypt large text files when evaluating the proposed system's performance. The security of the cloud has also been examined and compared to other existing encoding methods. © 2024, Iquz Galaxy Publisher. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A huge number of cloud users and cloud providers are threatened of security issues by cloud computing adoption. Cloud computing is a hub of virtualization that provides virtualization-based infrastructure over physically connected systems. With the rapid advancement of cloud computing technology, data protection is becoming increasingly necessary. It's important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of moving to cloud computing when deciding whether to do so. As a result of security and other problems in the cloud, cloud clients need more time to consider transitioning to cloud environments. Cloud computing, like any other technology, faces numerous challenges, especially in terms of cloud security. Many future customers are wary of cloud adoption because of this. Virtualization Technologies facilitates the sharing of recourses among multiple users. Cloud services are protected using various models such as type-I and type-II hypervisors, OS-level, and unikernel virtualization but also offer a variety of security issues. Unfortunately, several attacks have been built in recent years to compromise the hypervisor and take control of all virtual machines running above it. It is extremely difficult to reduce the size of a hypervisor due to the functions it offers. It is not acceptable for a safe device design to include a large hypervisor in the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). Virtualization is used by cloud computing service providers to provide services. However, using these methods entails handing over complete ownership of data to a third party. This paper covers a variety of topics related to virtualization protection, including a summary of various solutions and risk mitigation in VMM (virtual machine monitor). In this paper, we will discuss issues possible with a malicious virtual machine. We will also discuss security precautions that are required to handle malicious behaviors. We notice the issues of investigating malicious behaviors in cloud computing, give the scientific categorization and demonstrate the future headings. We've identified: i) security specifications for virtualization in Cloud computing, which can be used as a starting point for securing Cloud virtual infrastructure, ii) attacks that can be conducted against Cloud virtual infrastructure, and iii) security solutions to protect the virtualization environment from DDOS attacks. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, edge computing has become part of the Internet of Things (IoT) that plays a vital role in developing smart applications. As the usage of IoT devices significantly increases, at the same time, network edge infrastructure faces several security challenges. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is one of the most severe threats to edge-cloud services. Therefore, designing a robust mitigating system is unavoidable for the network edge, and it must be able to recognize emerging attacks. This work proposes an anomaly-based DDoS detection approach that combines information-theoretic metrics and multivariate correlation analysis. The information-theoretic metric captures the randomness and complex nature of traffic behaviour. Similarly, multivariate correlation analysis identifies the relationship among traffic features. Combining information metrics and correlation analysis, we generate normal and attack traffic profiles for the training base to estimate density. The generated profiles build on the metrics including Triangle Area Mapping (TAM) with correlation analysis, Renyi's divergence, covariance, mean, and standard deviation, which enhances the detection performance of the proposed approach. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using testbed and benchmark datasets. The results show that the proposed approach achieves 0.17% and 2.32%, and 0.50% higher accuracy compared to the baseline approaches on the testbed, UNSW and CIC-DDoS datasets, respectively. © 2023 IEEE.},

The urgency is required because with the new emerging paradigms of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing, billions of unsecured connected objects will be available. This document deals with the detection, and correction of DDoS attacks based on real-time behavioral analysis of traffic. This method is based on Software Defined Network (SDN) technologies, Bloom filter and automatic behaviour learning. Indeed, distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) are difficult to detect in real time. In particular, it concerns the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate packages. Our approach outlines a supervised classification method based on Machine Learning that identifies malicious and normal packets. Thus, we design and implement Defined (IDS) with a great precision. The results of the evaluation suggest that our proposal is timely and detects several abnormal DDoS-based cyber-attack behaviours. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a software application which monitors the system, network activities, finds vulnerabilities if present, and protects digital data in a safe manner. An IDS monitors network traffic and data, features selection, analysis and action or detection, and also alert generation during life cycle. Firewall technique is one of the system-based protection techniques which is used to protect the private network from the public network. The areas where IDSs are used are in financial, healthcare, technical fields like MANET, cloud computing and its security, data mining. There are three types of intrusion detection systems—HIDS, NIDS, and APIDS. HIDS is based on sensors, where it can obtain data from operating system. HIDS can also tell attacker’s activity by analyzing network. NIDS is also based on network sensors. NIDSs can collect network information and can audit network attacks, while packet is moving across the network. APIDS works based on behavior and event of the protocol. IDS prevents various attacks based on OSI layer like DoS or DDoS attack, eavesdropping, spoofing, U2R, logon abuse, application-based. IDS system can be affected by the signal strength where in this paper the objective is to enhance detection rate of intrusion detection system based on Wi-fi optimization where we have tried to show that how some basic materials can affect intrusion detection system through Wi-fi signal strength. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

Distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults, for example, may severely harm industrial processes and disrupt the whole supply chain, but this integration of technology also presents significant security issues. Therefore, it is crucial in the age of Industry 5.0 to create reliable DDoS attack detection systems. In this research, we offer a DDoS attack detection system for the Industry 5.0 environment that makes use of Digital Twins (DTs) and Machine Learning (ML). Our method takes use of the strengths of DTs to model the production flow virtually, which can then be used to track the system's behaviour and spot any hiccups. For further analysis of the DTs' output data in order to spot possible DDoS assaults, we use explicable ML algorithms like the decision tree classifier. © 2023 IEEE.},

Three main types of computing services are provided to people worldwide via the Internet. Increased performance and resource access are two benefits that come with using cloud computing, but there is also an increased chance of attack. As a result of this research, intrusion detection systems that can process massive amounts of data packets, analyse them, and produce reports using knowledge and behaviour analysis were created. Convolution Neural Network Algorithm encrypts data as it's being transmitted end-to-end and is stored in the cloud, providing an extra degree of security. Data protection in the cloud is improved by intrusion detection. This study uses a model to show how data is encrypted and decrypted, of an algorithm and describes the defences against attacks. When assessing the performance of the suggested system, it's critical to consider the time and memory needed to encrypt and decrypt big text files. Additionally, the security of the cloud has been investigated and contrasted with various encoding techniques now in use. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Low-rate Denial of service (LDoS) attacks has become one of the biggest threats to the Internet, cloud computing platforms, and big data centers. As an evolutionary species of DDoS attack, LDoS attack is essentially different from the DDoS attack. DDoS attacks are the behavior of malicious blocking legitimate network traffic by destroying the targets and the infrastructure around it with huge network traffic. While, LDoS attacks are the behavior of intentional degrading the quality of TCP links by throttling TCP flows to a small fraction of its ideal rate with periodic small pulse sequence. Hence, LDoS attack has a very small flow (around 10%-20% of the background traffic), it is easy to eluding the detection of routers and counter-DoS mechanisms. We try to reveal the mechanism of the LDoS attack and attempt to figure out the generation principle of LDoS attack in this paper. We classify the LDoS attacks and existing defense methods according to time domain and frequency domain in which detection and defense are performed. Furthermore, we highlight the filter approach to defense against LDoS attack. The initial purpose of our work is to encourage researchers to study effective ways to detect and defend against LDoS attacks with innovation and aggressiveness. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Botnets have typically been considered as a major security risk for networks. As the distinctions between regular and botnet traffic grow, botnet detection approaches based on traffic analysis frequently produce substantial false positive rates. BOTNET is a term that encompasses the internet's high-level complexity. Since the internet is the most important medium of communication, bot generate internet traffic. Botnet covers a wide range of internet problems, including spam, malware, click fraud, and phishing. Algorithms can withstand a variety of DDoS attacks. A variety of machine learning techniques can detect and mitigate these types of threats using optimization methodologies. This paper has designed and implemented a novel method called 'Multi-Objective Fish Swarm optimization with Fuzzy Association Rule for Botnet Detection System'. A Cloud wick interface is used to detect the live bots in Virtual Private Server. Real-time server data such as KDD-Cup and NSL-KDD datasets were used. These datasets are a collection of recorded network data used to support the construction of a new intruder detection system. RSD data is the real time network traffic data fetched through the built-in firewall of a dedicated private server. This implementation has been done by using 11 attributes extracted from the real time network. Out of the 11, 7 attributes are discrete and 4 attributes are continuous. The dataset is monitored every 6 minutes to obtain the results. The accuracy percentage for the Multi-Objective Fish Swarm optimization with Fuzzy Association Rule for Botnet Detection System is 99.4%. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The escalating adoption of hybrid-cloud infrastruc- ture technology across various fields results in a surge in resource utilization, encompassing server instances, databases, microservices, and other hybrid-cloud-based resources, thereby generating diverse log files. These logs serve various purposes, including classifying information based on urgency levels and facilitating data analysis for model training. Moreover, they play a pivotal role in detecting anomalies, such as DDoS attacks, bot-net access, and malware. This study aims to elucidate the process of gathering log files from various sources and processing them to detect bot-net access (formerly known as brute force attacks) across different protocols like SSH, FTP, and Kerberos. One-Hot Encoding is employed for feature extraction to identify bot-net access and distinguish it from other types of access logs. Sub-sequently, Deep Learning algorithms, including Simple Neural Network (SNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) are utilized for detection. Our findings reveal that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) emerges as the top performer, achieving the highest average accuracy of 86.681 %. These results advance anomaly detection capabilities in hybrid-cloud environments, thereby enhancing overall security measures. © 2024 IEEE.},

In this extremely large amount of data, there exists large amount of copies of repeated duplicate data. The term data duplication is nothing but compressed repeated data. In the existing system, the process of access control is implemented along with data deduplication which can be done on encrypted data as well. In the proposed system, the user will upload the files to the cloud and it will get changed into an encrypted format by the process of hashing which is done by using SHA-256 algorithm. Based on the existence of the file on the cloud server the user may upload or download the same. In addition, DDoS attack detection and implementation of two types of attacks, collusion attack and sybil attack detection for user identity is addressed.

	abstract = {In today's world the number of consumers of cloud computing is increasing day by day. So, security is a big concern for cloud computing environment to keep user's data safe and secure. Among different types of attacks in cloud one of the harmful and frequently occurred attack is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. DDoS is one type of flooding attack which is initiated by sending a large number of invalid packets to limit the services of the victim server. As a result, server can not serve the legitimate requests. DDoS attack can be done by a lot of strategies like malformed packets, IP spoofing, smurf attack, teardrop attack, syn flood attack, local area network denial (LAND) attack etc. This paper focuses on IP spoofing and LAND based DDoS attack. The objective of this paper is to propose an algorithm to detect and prevent IP spoofing and LAND attack. To achieve this objective a new approach is proposed combining two existing solutions of DDoS attack caused by IP spoofing and ill-formed packets. The proposed approach will provide a transparent solution, filter out the spoofed packets and minimize memory exhaustion through minimizing the number of insertions and updates required in the datatable. Finally, the approach is implemented and simulated using CloudSim 3.0 toolkit (a virtual cloud environment) followed by result analysis and comparison with existing algorithms. © 2019 IEEE.},

Identification of attack activities from legitimate network traffic by conventional network traffic monitoring systems are based on statistics. Conventional machine learning techniques are limited with current representational models. In this paper we propose a comparative analysis of hybrid deep learning algorithms and model development for prediction of diverse real-time distributed denial of service attacks. Hybrid deep learning algorithm is a quite effective way of detection and prevention. In this paper, algorithms of machine learning have been evaluated for performance and detection accuracies. We also compare machine learning and deep learning technology used to build forecast on time series ddos data. DDOS data will be provided to produce a forecasting model for prediction of denial of service attacks. This forecast model will be compared with our hybrid model to identify optimal deep learning model for real-time attack traffic detection and mitigation. © 2019, © 2019 Taru Publications.},

	abstract = {Recent report says Internet usage in country has exceeded half-billion people, driven by cheap data plans thus bridging digital gap between urban and rural India Elsewhere World Health Organization (WHO) prescribed ratio of doctorpatient limit is 1:1000, but in India an average government doctor attends 11,082 people. With such shortage, future health of individuals in India seems notoriously uncertain. This provides an opportunity to intro-duce remote healthcare services allowing patients to have virtual consultations with doctors from anywhere. However, we should consider that healthcare industry faces unique challenges when it comes to the identification and authentication of medical services online. People are conscious of privacy in healthcare.This paper presents a comprehensive study of Machine Learning and advancements in Reinforcement Learning Algorithms, which help develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. Proposed system consists of wearable sensors to collect user data and LoRaWAN to connect with the Internet. These measure pulse rate and body temperature of patient and monitor vital signs of health. A standalone local server to process raw sensor signals, display health data, and trigger alert if emergency detected. IoT cloud server implementation provides functionalities like web monitoring, mobile applications. For security services, the architecture uses data categorization function, key management services. We used Encryption to ensure secure communication and entity authentication, implemented Reinforcement Learning focusing security and privacy in IoT and considered authentication, detection and mitigation of DDoS, Man-in-Middle attacks, intrusion detection, malware analysis.

This cloud deployment mode makes it convenient for IoT devices to participate in the interaction between supply and demand, and at the same time exposes various vulnerabilities of IoT devices to the Internet, which can be easily accessed and manipulated by hackers to launch large-scale DDoS attacks. As an easy-to-understand supervised learning classification algorithm, KNN can obtain more accurate classification results without too many adjustment parameters, and has achieved many research achievements in the field of DDoS detection. However, in the face of high-dimensional data, this method has high operation cost, high cost and not practical. Aiming at this disadvantage, this chapter explores the potential of classical KNN algorithm in data storage structure, K-nearest neighbor search and hyperparameter optimization, and proposes an improved KNN algorithm for DDoS attack detection of demand-side IoT devices. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the fifth generation of computing, the Cloud Architecture needs rigid security on to its virtualized network by representing the physical units in terms of logical Connections. Network Virtualization in 5G should also provide enhanced security to cloud data against the threat raise by the third party. In the existing schemes, the security mechanisms like detection and prevention of security have been implemented successfully to augment the security. But in 5G networking, when the mobile users are concerned, two features are additionally added to check for the security with the existing feature like Preliminary Authorization, that is validating, before entering into the network. As soon as the task is implemented, handover mechanism is used. In our proposed system the process of preliminary approval and handover is going reduce the latency in the virtualized network mode by Virtualized Handover with Authorization technique (VHAT). In this VHAT scheme the Tree Based Switch Analysis Algorithm (VN-TBSAA) is constructed to check for the packets sent by the sender to the receiver. Moreover, in our proposed TBSAA algorithm takes the flow table of content as input and detects the Distribution of Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is detected, by preventing through redirecting methodology. The overloading happens in case of multiple packets arrival to the same destination point to overcome with this problem in proposed system a methodology called VN-TBSAA is used to reduce attack raised on flow table, to devise it with overloaded entry. this could be avoided via identifying the attacker by assigning the packets to beneath load entry in the flow table. This is going to be implemented by Artificial Neural Network with personal fuzzy identification like biometric or iris. The added advantage of the proposed system is improving the security and reduced time by dropping the fault packets send by them. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Computing in the cloud is a relatively recent innovation that involves sending data processing jobs to third-party service providers through the Internet. Cloud computing comes with several benefits, such as reduced overhead costs, expandable capabilities, and changeable pricing. However, there are several concerns about the cloud's level of security. DDoS assaults, also known as distributed denial-of-service attacks, pose a danger to cloud infrastructure. In order to defend against DDoS assaults in the cloud, a variety of different machine learning algorithms have been developed. However, there is not yet a general agreement on employing machine learning to protect against DDoS assaults in the cloud. In addition, as the number of relevant literature increases, it becomes more challenging to monitor all of it, much alone characterize the current state of the art or identify emerging gaps in study. This project aims to conduct a literature review on DDoS machine learning approaches for the cloud. To that aim, the purpose of this study is to undertake a methodical examination of the existing research that discusses cloud machine learning algorithms for DDoS in an attempt to synthesize the evidence associated with this topic. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing, despite being a groundbreaking technology, has increased the risk of attacks that exploit cloud services, leading to the exhaustion of resource allocations. One such attack is Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS), which uses pay-per-use services to gradually increase resource demand, potentially leading to financial disaster for service provider. The Cyber Range Lab at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), located in Canberra, conducted nine injection attacks to test machine learning and deep learning algorithms. These experiments involved multi-classification, incorporating nine different types of attack data. Among the presented algorithms, the RNN-LSTM method achieved an accuracy of 84%. Various statistical analyses, such as mean square error (MSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (R), and root mean square error (RMSE), were used to evaluate prediction errors between input data and values generated by different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Despite its relatively low prediction level (MSE=0.560), the Recurrent Neural Network Long Short Term Memory (RNNLSTM) algorithm achieved an R2 level of 82.09%when applied to the multi-classification dataset. The suggested system's performance was compared to existing EDoS attack detection systems, and the RNN-LSTM-based attack mitigation algorithms demonstrated superior performance. This study aims to contribute to the identification and effective protection of cloud-based resources that could be exploited by Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, thereby preventing financial losses for potential victims. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Software defined networking (SDN) architecture frame- work eases the work of the network administrators by separating the data plane from the control plane. This provides a programmable interface for applications development related to security and management. The centralized logical controller provides more control over the total network, which has complete network visibility. These SDN advantages expose the network to vulnerabilities and the impact of the attacks is much severe when compared to traditional networks, where the network devices have protection from the attacks and limits the occurrence of attacks. In this paper, we proposed an entropy based algorithm in SDN to detect as well as stopping distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on the servers or clouds or hosts. Firstly, there explored various attacks that can be launched on SDN at different layers. Basically DDoS is one kind of denial of service attack in which an attacker uses multiple distributed sources for attacking a particular server. Every network in a system has an entropy and an increase in the randomness of probability causes entropy to decrease. In comparison with previous entropy based approaches this approach has higher performance in distinguishing legal and illegal traffics and blocking illegal traffic paths. Linux OS and Mininet Simulator along with POX controller are used to validate the proposed approach. By conducting pervasive simulation along with theoretical analysis this method can definitely detect and stop DDoS attacks automatically. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service attacks, in the recent times, have become a critical threat to not only private server connections but also meta scale cloud computing environments. This research paper furnishes a detailed analysis of five machine learning algorithms in context with network intrusion detection that are; Isolation Forest, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The dataset used in this study, to differentiate between attack and normal cases, is the KDD cup 1999, wherein the dataset has been converted into binary classes to differentiate between the attack and normal cases. Following are the part of the research; Preprocessing the data, Scaling the features, Training the model and evaluating the performance using crucial metrics like accuracy, precision and F1 score and recall. Graphical representation and confusion matrices for data visualization have been made use of in addition to the aforementioned. The results show a penetrative information about the relative effectiveness and success of different ML algorithms in identifying network intrusions and hence can be used as insightful references for academics and practitioners in the field of network security. A well- explained algorithm selection, based on performance indicators enables an advanced approach to the study, thus providing a framework for further developments in systems of intrusion detection. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have become one of the most serious threats to cloud network. Currently, most of the research on DDoS attack mitigation focuses on DDoS traffic detection without considering further analysis (e.g., fine-grained classification of mixed attack traffic). By further analysis, we can provide more support for attack interception and traceback. This paper proposes a new abnormal traffic classification method A3DC (Autoencoder-based Three-Dimensional Linear Cluster) to overcome the difficulty of fine-grained distinguishing DDoS attacks under a small amount of labelled training data in cloud network environment. Based on a novel proposed 3D cluster algorithm, A3DC method consisting of three stages, which are data normalization preprocessing, autoencoder downscaling, and data clustering, is designed. The experimental results on the public data set show that A3DC is significantly superior to existing methods in terms of mixed attack traffic classification and is able to obtain higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate in DDoS attack detection. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {With the increasing adoption of cloud computing and the emergence of Industry 4.0, the need for robust intrusion detection mechanisms to safeguard cloud-based systems against Distributed Denial of Services Attacks (DDoS) attacks has become more critical than ever. This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques and Deep Learning (DL) for DDoS attack detection in cloud environments. Utilizing the CIC-IDS 2017 dataset, transformed from tabular data into image-based formats for DL model compatibility, we evaluate 27,001 instances of normal traffic and 21,844 DDoS attack instances. We preprocess network traffic data and explore various DL architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of DL models against traditional ML algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), using standard evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the superior performance of DL models, particularly the BLSTM model, with an accuracy of 96.35%, precision of 97.42%, recall of 94.39%, F1 score of 95.88%, and ROC AUC score of 96.17%. Through in-depth analysis and discussion, we provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different intrusion detection mechanisms, such as the higher interpretability of ML models and the superior discriminatory power of DL models. These findings offer valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers in enhancing the security of cloud-based systems against DDoS attacks. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

	abstract = {Business and public enterprises have transitioned to cloud-based services. Most of the service-based companies do their core business activities using the cloud services allowing more accessibility, allowing multiple users to share the data regardless of their location. These new technologies also attract a lot of intruders and they use DDos as one of the main methods of attack. With increased amount of data and services being on cloud services Early detection of such attacks are dominant to any business. New innovation also attracts a rampant increase in the volume and frequency of DDoS attacks. New generation mechanism and technique are required for deal with new types of DDos attacks. With Increasing number of businesses, educational institutions, cultural organizations relying on cloud services, the detection system should not only be effective but also affordable to be masses. Thus, in this work, a proposed strategic-level framework that combines feature engineering mechanisms with Bio-Inspired optimization technique and machine learning. The models also are verified with opposite confirmation and tested for area-under-curve analysis. It provides a wide range of reliable solutions to avoid data overload problems while detecting direct DDoS flood attacks on Cloud. The framework is tested on the new DDoS test database (CICDDoS2019) with the DT classifier. To validate the proposed system, The other machine learning techniques are selected from literature and compared the obtained results. Test results showed that the use of feature engineering techniques with the Dragonfly optimization algorithm and Decision Tree separator achieved a high accuracy rate (98.69%) in the detection of DDoS flood attacks in a cloud environment. The results suggest that the proposed strategic level framework could achieve better results in DDoS flood attacks detection on Cloud by promising reductions in cargo loads and times. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.},

Consequently, it is vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) assaults. Several agreed computers are utilised a DDoS attack to attack network services and hosts, resulting in flooding of messages, corrupted packets, and connection requests, and loss of service to the valid user. The use of network-connected devices is fast increasing in the digital era, which leads to an increase in cyberattacks. DDoS attacks are growing more difficult to spot among them. We may reduce redundancy and error rate in the classification process by using the random forest technique, as well as eliminate all empty/missing values from the data set. When we use the random forest algorithm rather than the Naive Bayes algorithm, we receive a 100% high accuracy rate. In the random forest algorithm, the false positive rate is 0.00. The main objective is to detect whether the request from IP address is an attack or not. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The operator needs to determine the diversion rule installation and elimination in the networks, as well as the scrubbing resource activation and revocation in the SCs, while minimizing the long-term cost and the cumulative decision-switching penalty without knowing the exact amount of the malicious trafic. We model and formulate this problem as an online nonlinear integer program. In contrast to many other online problems where future inputs are unknown but at least current inputs are known, a key new challenge here is that even part of the current inputs are unknown when decisions are made. To łlearnž the best decisions online, we transform our problem via a gap-preserving approximation into an online optimization problem with only the known inputs, which is further relaxed and decoupled into a series of one-shot convex programs solvable in individual time slots. To overcome the intractability, we design a progressive rounding algorithm to convert fractional decisions into integral ones without violating the constraints. We characterize the competitive ratio of our approach as a function of the key parameters of our problem. We conduct evaluations using real-world data and conirm our algorithms’ superiority over de facto practices and state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

The massive internet of things network is influenced by the malware principle at some point due to the lack of security frameworks. the delay in detection of Phishing attacks is highly demandable to secure the confidential data. the proposed model considers machine learning algorithms such as Naïve Bayes (NB), Support vector machine (SVM) and Decision tree(DT) etc. the comparative study and analysis of best performing model is simulated here. Using an Intrusion Detection System-generated dataset, this work was completed. This project aims to determine the improved algorithm's accuracy in detecting cyberattacks. The aim of an attack is to flood system resources with a lot of unreal traffic, making resources or services unavailable. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing would be an easy method to obtain services, resources and applications from any location on the internet. In the future of data generation, it is an unavoidable conclusion. Despite its many attractive properties, the cloud is vulnerable to a variety of attacks. One such well-known attack that emphasizes the availability of amenities is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). A DDoS assault overwhelms the server with massive quantities of regular or intermittent traffic. It compromises with the cloud servers’ services and makes it harder to reply to legitimate users of the cloud. A monitoring system with correct resource scaling approach should be created to regulate and monitor the DDoS assault. The network is overwhelmed with excessive traffic of significant resource usage requests during the attack, resulting in the denial of needed services to genuine users. In this research, a unique way to the analyze resources used by the cloud users, lowering of the resources consumed is done when the network is overburdened with excessive traffic, and the dynamic cloud load balancing algorithm DCLB (Dynamic Cloud Load Balancing) is used to balance the overhead towards the server. The core premise is to monitor traffic using the fuzzy logic approach, which employs different traffic parameters in conjunction with various built in measured to recognize the DDoS attack traffic in the network. Finally, the proposed method shows a 93% of average detection rate when compared to the existing model. This method is a unique attempt to comprehend the importance of DDoS mitigation techniques as well as good resource management during an attack and analysis of the. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

These smart city devices have the ability to perform communications on their own which require free flow of data. The interconnectivity has also resulted in exponential growth of data being processed, making it susceptible to intrusion attacks. Traditional IDS systems are not designed to work efficiently in an IoT network as these devices have restricted resources and sparse functionality. To tackle the cyber security threats in IoT, MCIDS (Multi Classifier Intrusion Detection system) has been proposed which is based on deep learning algorithm. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is utilised to train and test the model.

Making it vulnerable to DDoS using the TCP SYN attack on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Thus, with a potential propagation to the different servers located in both fog and the cloud infrastructures of the CPS. This study compares the effectiveness of supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised machine learning algorithms, as well as statistical models for detecting DDoS attacks in CPS-IoT. The models considered are broadly grouped into three: (i) ML-based detection - Logistic Regression, K-Means, and Artificial Neural Networks with two variants based on traffic slicing. We also investigated the effectiveness of semi-supervised hybrid learning models, which used unsupervised K-Means to label the data, then fed the output to a supervised learning model for attack detection. (ii) Statistic-based detection - Exponentially Weighted Moving Average and Linear Discriminant Analysis. (Iii) Prediction ‘algorithms - LGR, Kernel Ridge Regression and Support Vector Regression. Results of simulations showed that the hybrid model was able to achieve 100% accuracy with near zero false positives for all the ML models, while traffic slicing traffic helped improved detection time; the statistical models performed comparatively poorly, while the prediction models were able to achieve over 94% attack prediction accuracy. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {The recent advancements in ubiquitous sensing powered by Wireless Computing Technologies (WCT) and Cloud Computing Services (CCS) have introduced a new thinking ability amongst researchers and healthcare professionals for building secure and connected healthcare systems. The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) in healthcare services further brings in several challenges with it, mainly including encrypted communication through vulnerable wireless medium, authentication and access control algorithms and ownership transfer schemes (important patient information). Major concern of such giant connected systems lies in creating the data handling strategies which is collected from the billions of heterogeneous devices distributed across the hospital network. Besides, the resource constrained nature of IoT would make these goals difficult to achieve. Motivated by aforementioned deliberations, this paper introduces a novel approach in designing a security framework for edge-computing based connected healthcare systems. An efficient, multi-factor access control and ownership transfer mechanism for edge-computing based futuristic healthcare applications is the core of proposed framework. Data scalability is achieved by employing distributed approach for clustering techniques that analyze and aggregate voluminous data acquired from heterogeneous devices individually before it transits the to the cloud. Moreover, data/device ownership transfer scheme is considered to be the first time in its kind. During ownership transfer phase, medical server facilitates user to transfer the patient information/ device ownership rights to the other registered users. In order to avoid the existing mistakes, we propose a formal and informal security analysis, that ensures the resistance towards most common IoT attacks such as insider attack, denial of distributed service (DDoS) attack and traceability attacks. © 2020 IEEE.},

To obtain performance, a hybrid improved wolf optimizer with asymmetric key Goldwasser cryptography (IWO-AKGC) algorithm was proposed based on combining the exploitation ability of security and exploration capability of machine learning. In addition to the selection of parameters, a proposed hybrid IWO-AKGC technique is used for weighting and bias coefficients in neural network models. This has led to an immediate improvement in communication security for the delivery of different types of data services via clouds, thanks to the proposed IWO-AKGC method. The recommended hybrid optimizer successfully addresses the drawbacks of conventional methods, such as local stagnation problems, delayed convergence problems, and local and global optimal trapping problems. Thus, secured data communication is obtained for cloud service provisioning. The proposed model proved to be a better model for DDoS intrusion detection. © 2024, IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aim: Cloud Security is a strong hindrance which discourages organisations to move toward cloud despite huge benefits. Distributed denial of service attacks operated via distributed systems compromise availability of cloud services which cause limited resources for authentic users and high expense for cloud service users and business owners. Objective: Techniques to identify distributed denial of service attacks with minimized false positives are highly required to ensure availability of cloud services to genuine users. Scarcity of solution which can detect denial of service attacks with minimum false positives and reduced detection delay has motivated us to compare classification algorithms for detection of distributed denial of service attacks with minimum false positive rate. Methods: Classification of incoming requests and outgoing responses using machine learning algorithms is a quite effective way of detection and prevention. We designed a performance tuned support vector machine algorithm with features of F-hold cross validation strategy. Results: F-hold crosses validation strategy, which can detect denial of service packets with 99.89% accuracy. Conclusion: This system ensures economic sustainability for business owners and limited resources mitigation for authenticated and valid cloud users. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {To mitigate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks towards enterprise networks, we study the problem of scheduling DDoS traffic through on-premises scrubbing at the local edge and on-demand scrubbing in the remote clouds. We model this problem as a nonlinear mixed- integer program, which is characterized by the inputs of arbitrary dynamics and the trade-offs between staying at suboptimal scrubbing locations and using different best locations with switching overhead. We first design a prediction-oblivious online algorithm which consists of a carefully-designed fractional algorithm to pursue the long-term total cost minimization but avoid excessive switching overhead over time, and a randomized rounding algorithm to derive the flow-based, integral decisions. We next design a prediction-aware online algorithm which leverages the predicted inputs and can make even better scheduling decisions through invoking our prediction-oblivious online algorithm and improving its solutions via re-solving the original problem slice over each prediction window. We further extend our study to prioritize local scrubbing, and adapt our algorithms to this case correspondingly. Then, we rigorously prove the worst-case, constant competitive performance guarantees of our online algorithms. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations and validate the superiority of our approach over multiple existing alternatives approaches. IEEE},

	abstract = {Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks aim to deny service, and these attacks have long been a serious threat to networks. DDoS attacks can quickly drain the network resource server or server capacity, prevent access to resources, and cause negative effects such as a loss of profits and the inability to use services and perform transactions. Network users currently encounter an unprecedented range of attacks and threats that lead to large-scale losses. Therefore, timely and reliable detection of various attacks has become urgent. Many solutions have been proposed to develop intrusion detection systems (IDSs). These solutions are widely used to search for unauthorized sources. However, IDSs must be constantly improved because species attacks on various network entities evolve continuously. Intrusion detection is divided into two levels depending on the intrusion source: host-based detection and network intrusion detection. This study proposes a model designed using DDoS dataset analysis, which is practical for large datasets subject to DDoS attacks, and an intelligent metaheuristic algorithm for training and classification based on the selected attack intent and in which one attack is included among blacklisted IPs. The common goal of the proposed approach and related approaches is to detect DDoS attacks. The metric scores are presented concisely in a confusion matrix to easily calculate other representative evaluation measures, such as precision, accuracy, and sensitivity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This paper is interested in some of the existing algorithms that distribute the workload evenly. These algorithms aim to avoid the blind assignment that often results in some over-loaded servers while another node might be under-loaded. In this work a combination of two inspired metaheuristic algorithms BAT and cuckoo search was proposed; the first algorithm can utilize fast exploration using global search, the latter algorithm can avoid trapping into BAT local optimum problem using levy flight with a far random walk. Additonaly, the proposed algorithm could be used to mitigate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that aims to cause endless load on the servers and stop the service. Experimental results for five virtual machine (VM), ten VM, with the varying number of tasks showed that the proposed algorithm has better resource utilization and less makespan time in almost all the cases. © 2022.

	abstract = {Cloud computing offers internet-based services to access various on-demand resources by overcoming the necessity of centralized computing. There are plenty of challenges, like privacy, security, load balancing, resource provisioning, existing in this virtualized environment. Among them, security is one of the major complications. Concerning the security and privacy issues, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks can cause great damage to the availability of cloud services and resources. Till now, attack mitigation strategies residues is an on-going research challenge due to the attack tendency to advance in sophistication and ease of implementation. Moreover, cloud service customers, as well as providers, need to be observant in understanding the menaces of DDoS attacks. The crux of such attack mitigation mechanism is to assure early and fast detection of illegitimate entries into the network. To address such monitoring and detecting mechanism, this paper aims to address various nature-inspired algorithms which are having the propensity to resolve malware issues, such as DDoS attacks, naturally by offering an optimized solution. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Rapid advancements in internet applications introduce new vulnerabilities and threats that malicious actors are keen to exploit. These activities are becoming more versatile and challenging to address. In addition to implementing firewalls to control the inbound and outbound network traffic, an intrusion detection system (IDS) is commonly employed to monitor the network for malicious activities and policy violations. However, most IDSs are generally designed to monitor network traffic. They are incapable to detect the vulnerabilities embedded in the legitimate packets, especially the vulnerabilities targeting web applications. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based IDS with an emphasis on the detection of OWASP Top 10 Injection vulnerabilities, combined with additional common vulnerabilities such as brute-forcing and session hijacking. Furthermore, DDoS attacks, which are commonly seen, can also be detected with our proposed adaptable HTTP flooding detection engine. We also provide the evaluation to show that our proposed scheme provides fewer false positives than SNORT and gives efficient system throughput based on the leverage of Kafka and Spark streaming. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {DDoS attacks, also known as distributed denial-of-service attacks, pose a significant risk to networks in the cloud. The attackers aim to flood the target system with an overwhelming amount of data and requests until it becomes completely overloaded and unable to function properly. These attacks are becoming smarter and more dangerous all the time. A low-rate DDoS attack is one such strategy that makes detection difficult. At the same time, cloud infrastructure is rapidly evolving. Container-based technology makes it possible for cloud computing to use resources efficiently and scale services in a flexible way. Existing methods for detecting DDoS attacks in cloud computing are insufficient when adversaries use low-rate DDoS attacks. A method is required that can not only identify the attack but also prevent it to some extent. A Low-Rate DDoS Attack Detection Framework (LRDADF) was proposed for this purpose when adversaries use low-rate DDoS attacks. A comprehensive approach is required because low-rate DDoS attacks are difficult to detect. In addition to employing deep learning methods to detect such attacks, we proposed a mathematical model to realize a mitigation strategy. As a result, we proposed a new algorithm called the Hybrid Approach for Low-Rate DDoS Detection (HA-LRDD). The algorithm employs an AI-enabled method comprised of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a deep auto encoder. We defined another algorithm called Dynamic Low-Rate DDoS Mitigation (DLDM), which mitigates the impact of an attack once it has been identified. It also ensures that the attack is defeated and that the infrastructure continues to operate. A comprehensive simulation study revealed that the proposed framework is capable of detecting and mitigating low-rate DDoS attacks to ensure an acceptable level of service in cloud computing environments. © 2023},

	abstract = {The recent evolution of cloud computing has enabled the cloudification of Telecommunication (Telecom) network functions. The cloud-based Telecom infrastructure is more scalable, flexible, and cost-efficient for service providers. However, a significant security challenge for Telecom cloud providers is ensuring the availability of services provided to users by mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The fact that Virtual Network Functions (VNF) in the Telecom cloud are hosted on the Internet makes them easy targets for large-scale DDoS attacks. This study proposes the use of secured supervised Federated Learning (FL) with an efficient Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (H-RNN) for DDOS attack mitigation in the Telecom cloud. The proposed H-RNN model combines LSTM, a Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU), and a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) to obtain a state-of-the-art LSTM+BiGRU+BiLSTM model. FL is used with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, which supports data privacy and integrity in heterogeneous Telecom cloud networks. The simulation results using the CICDDOS2019 benchmark dataset displayed a detection accuracy of 99.59%, a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.042%, and an average detection time of 0.062 ms. A novel H-RNN model and secured FL are proposed to enable deep-learning-based anti-DDoS technology building and deployment in cloud-based Telecom networks. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group.},

A realistic cyber security dataset of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications, called edge-IIoTset, are used to design a Bayesian learning model. The proposed model is designed on a fog layer based on hybrid computing technology. IoT data generated from devices are collected for analysis. While doing analysis, regression analysis is done for Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is under Denial of Service (DOS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack, injection attacks and malware attacks. The regression analysis model is designed to check the probability of possible attacks and verify the technological capability of devices. The 80% dataset is used as training data and 20% data is used for testing data. After the results are verified with regression analysis.

	abstract = {The in-built insecurity of a network of systems has made it vulnerable to attacks from cyber criminals. In the current scenario, the most complex vulnerability threat is posed by Botnet that forms a large volume of illegitimate network traffic. It causes security issues such as organizing snap bending traps, abusing extraordinary computational assets, accessing client data, sending spam messages and DDoS attacks, all of which are caused by botnets. With an intention of addressing the issues in DDoS attack, the present study adopted a novel approach to effectively predict the malware attack on the virtual machine (VM). One aspect of novelty in this approach is the maiden venture of adopting the concept of streamlining network efficiency by using an enhanced packet information algorithm (EPIA), the other novelty included adopting an improved bald eagle search (IBES) optimization strategy. The actual implementation is performed on JAVA platform through three datasets NSL-KDD 99, UNSW-NB15 and N-BaIoT datasets. An overview of the overall performance of the three datasets clearly shows that IBES_HSKiNET_EKNN has recorded a peak performance in every matrix through an average accuracy of 99.6% and detection rate of 99.3%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing refers to the availability of IT resources based on the, particularly data storage and processing power, without the direct intervention of users to manage them. Perpetrators are taking advantage of its multi-tenant feature to deny services to the clients by orchestrating attacks called Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. A more advanced version of DoS attacks called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks has been causing a lot of damage to service providers and clients. As a result, the importance of detecting these attacks is critical. This paper provides a hybrid approach for detecting the DDoS attacks using Self Organizing Map (SOM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). SOM is used to find the outliers, i.e. attacks, by reducing the high-dimensional dataset into a 2-dimensional representation of input space. ANN is trained on the outliers from SOM to predict attacks. The dataset used for the experiment is the real cyber defense dataset CICIDS 2017. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy of 99.66% and low false positive rate of 0.004. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The persistent issue is that cloud applications fortified post-deployment with security patches remain susceptible to sophisticated attack vectors. In response to this, the discourse introduces an innovative, lightweight header layer designed to preemptively filter incoming requests prior to their processing by Cloud Virtual Machines (CVMs). Leveraging a combination of instantaneous and temporal analytics, this layer is adept at the early detection and neutralization of a broad spectrum of both active and passive cybersecurity threats, significantly bolstering the resilience of cloud deployments against malicious endeavors. To operationalize this defense mechanism, the system deploys an advanced logging framework capable of high-velocity data capture, triggered by an array of header-level events such as authentication attempts, access requests, and the temporal intervals between successive requests. This granular data collection strategy equips the system with a comprehensive dataset, derived from continuous user interactions, which is subsequently subjected to an intricate post-processing regimen aimed at the extraction of multimodal features. This process involves the manual tagging of request-response pairs by a curated group of users, facilitating the identification of diverse threat signatures such as temporal attack probabilities, IP-based attack typologies, user access patterns, and anomalies in request-response dynamics. At the heart of this model lies a sophisticated deep transfer learning framework, integrating the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), trained on an extensive corpus of user-generated data. This hybrid RNN methodology enables the model to discern and classify a wide array of attack vectors with remarkable accuracy. An incremental learning module further refines the model's efficacy, enabling dynamic adaptation and continuous improvement in its predictive accuracy, precision, and recall metrics across various attack scenarios, including but not limited to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), brute force, cross-site scripting, SQL injection, as well as more passive threats like access control breaches and restricted ownership transfer attempts. Empirical evaluations of this model underscore its superior performance, achieving notable accuracy rates in detecting authentication attacks (99.3%), unauthorized access attempts (97.1%), DDoS and similar request-pattern aberrations (99.1%), and Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks (99.2%). When benchmarked against contemporary models, this innovative approach demonstrated a performance uplift of 6.5%, underscoring its viability for real-time deployment and scalability across diverse cloud networking scenarios. © 2024, Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

	abstract = {The recent development of cloud computing offers various services on demand for organization and individual users, such as storage, shared computing space, networking, etc. Although Cloud Computing provides various advantages for users, it remains vulnerable to many types of attacks that attract cyber criminals. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is the most common type of attack on cloud computing. Consequently, Cloud computing professionals and security experts have focused on the growth of preventive processes towards DDoS attacks. Since DDoS attacks have become increasingly widespread, it becomes difficult for some DDoS attack methods based on individual network flow features to distinguish various types of DDoS attacks. Further, the monitoring pattern of traffic changes and accurate detection of DDoS attacks are most important and urgent. In this research work, DDoS attack detection methods based on deep belief network feature extraction and Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model have been proposed with NSL-KDD dataset. In Hybrid LSTM method, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique, which is combined to optimize the weights of the LSTM neural network, reduces the prediction error. This deep belief network method is used to extract the features of IP packets, and it identifies DDoS attacks based on PSO-LSTM model. Moreover, it accurately predicts normal network traffic and detects anomalies resulting from DDoS attacks. The proposed PSO-LSTM architecture outperforms the classification techniques including standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) and LSTM in terms of attack detection performance along with the results of the measurement of accuracy, recall, f-measure, precision. © 2023 Authors.

	abstract = {The widespread usage of the Internet has increased network security issues. Some of the serious threats are Brute force, Heartbleed, Botnet, Web attacks, DoS, DDoS, and Infiltration of the network. With the increased usage of online services and the development of new technologies like IoT, Cloud, Edge, and Mobile Computing, the detection of these threats is important and becoming paramount. This study presents an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) framework by proposing various hybrid models for the detection of malicious traffic. The models are developed using feature selection techniques, namely Recursive Feature Elimination, Chi-Square, Principal Component Analysis, and five Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In this experiment, the standard CSE-CIC-IDS 2018 dataset is used to examine the performance evaluation of the proposed approaches. In this paper, according to the comparison of the proposed hybrid approaches, Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest performs better than the other approaches with an accuracy of 99.23%. The proposed approach provides better accuracy as compared to earlier reported similar approaches in the literature. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing's popularity is on the rise, attracting a select number of organizations investing in this realm, either for internal use or to serve others. However, this surge in cloud innovation has led to the emergence of fresh security concerns impacting both customers and the industry. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has been increasingly employed in cloud systems. ML techniques have found application in various contexts, aiming to pre-emptively detect and mitigate potential attacks and vulnerabilities within the Cloud. Our study presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) delving into security protocols and strategies at the intersection of cloud technology and machine learning. Examining 63 significant studies, our SLR findings are classified into three principal research domains: (I) the diverse array of security threats prevalent in Cloud computing, (ii) the spectrum of machine learning techniques utilized, and (iii) the resulting outcomes and implications of these methodologies. Moreover, distributed denial-ofservice (DDoS) and information security stand out as the most prominent Cloud security domains, accounting for 16% and 14% of usage, respectively. In our analysis, we discovered that 30 distinct ML methods employed a combination of both independent and pre-existing hybrid strategies. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, both the general public and commercial enterprises have grown more and more interested in using cloud services. The majority of businesses use cloud computing technologies for production operations, which draws hackers. Nowadays, one of the most popular methods used to obstruct the availability of essential internet services is Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) floods. These attacks either totally destroy the victim or overload it with a massive amount of traffic that prevents it from carrying out normal communication. The cloud's services are fully suspended if there are any delays in identifying flooding attacks. A preprocessing stage in cloud DDoS attack defence known as feature engineering has been recognized as having the potential to improve classification accuracy and lower computing complexity. In this article, we suggest a DDoS intrusion detection system for use in cloud environments. The application of filter and wrapper-based feature selection techniques along with machine learning is proposed as a hybrid ensemble-based feature engineering strategy. The benchmark dataset, which fills in the gaps in the current datasets and comprises a wide range of direct DDoS flooding attacks, is used to assess the model. To prevent data overfitting issues, area-user-curve analysis is also assessed. When compared to previous benchmarking techniques, the evaluation and findings revealed a considerable improvement in attack detection. This framework offers a high detection rate and classification accuracy when contrasted with the existing framework. Hence, it is more suitable for protecting the cloud. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2023.},

	abstract = {A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to reduce normal traffic service, or network by spreading a target or its associated infrastructure with an internet traffic flood. The salient features of Cloud Computing (CC) are being leveraged by attackers for launching severe DDoS attacks. However, DDoS attacks are very challenging to detect and mitigate the attacks accurately due to their distributed nature. This research proposes the Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based Support Vector Machine Activation Kernel (DCNN-based SVMAK) for detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks accurately using Deep Learning (DL). Initially, the CIC-DDoS2019 and Bot-IoT datasets are utilized to evaluate the proposed technique, and min-max normalization is employed for normalizing the obtained data. Then, the data imbalance issue will be overcome using the Weighted Optimized Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (WSMOTE). The Hybrid Golden-Seagull optimization (HGSO) is performed by changing sin into cos function for feature selection. The DCNN-based SVMAK is established for the detection and classification of DDoS attacks. If the attack is detected, the BAIT approach is used to mitigate the DDoS. The existing approaches like CNN-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM), AutoEncoder-Multi-layer Perceptron Network (AE-MLP), Wrapper Feature selection-based Hybrid DL (WF-HDL) are used to compare with the proposed approach. The proposed approach achieves better accuracy of 99.81% and 99.87% for CIC-DDoS2019 and Bot-IoT datasets compared to CNN-BiLSTM, AE-MLP, and WF-HDL respectively. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In cloud computing environment DDoS attacks are continually evolving with intelligent strategies. Low-rate DDoS attack is one such strategy that make it difficult to detect attack. At the same time, cloud infrastructure is also evolving rapidly. Container based technology enables cloud computing to have lightweight approaches in resource utilization and flexibility in scaling services. The existing DDoS attack detection methods used in cloud computing are not adequate when adversaries employ the modality known low-rate DDoS attack. There is need for an approach that not only detects the attack but also defeat the attack as much as possible. Towards this end, in this paper, we proposed a framework named Low-Rate DDoS Attack Detection Framework (LRDADF). Since low-rate DDoS attacks are difficult to be defeated, we proposed a mathematical model to realize mitigation strategy besides employing deep learning methods to have effective means of detecting such attacks. We proposed an algorithm named Hybrid Approach for Low-Rate DDoS Detection (HA-LRDD). The algorithm uses an Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled methods comprising of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deep autoencoder. Another algorithm known as Dynamic Low-Rate DDoS Mitigation (DLDM) is used to minimize the effect of the attack after detection or even defeat the attack by ensuring the smooth functioning of cloud infrastructure which is under attack. Extensive simulation study revealed that the proposed framework is able to detect low-rate DDoS attacks and also mitigate the attacks to ensure there is acceptable quality of service in cloud computing environments. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud services are often delivered through HTTP protocol for ease and reduced cost for both service providers and users. The only drawback is that these protocols and the cloud itself are more prone to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. There is the need for a detection setup that is lightweight, robust and easily deployable on these architectures with an improved efficiency. We thus propose a novel multi-feature hybrid classification based DDOS detection setup that uses the Representational State Transfer (REST)-Application Programming Interface (API) for the attack prediction. The cloud architectures we are using are Heroku, one of the first developed platform as a service (paas) computing platform by salesforce and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, one of the most sought after and on-demand infrastructure as a service (iaas) computing platform by amazon. The GitHub repository holds the pre-trained hybrid classifier in its repository which is accessed using the REST-API by the cloud. The HTTP request and response commands are sent to the cloud architecture through the Postman API client where the final attack prediction is done. This makes our cloud burden free as the detection is done outside its domain. The hybrid classifier here is the integration of Random Forest classifier, Decision Tree classifier, Support Vector Machine and XGBoost classifier, all trained on the pre-processed Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) Cup 99 and UNSW-NB15 datasets. Here we are also using two different feature ranking methods i.e., statistical feature ranking and machine learning ranking. It shows the best accuracy results with information gain on KDD Cup 99 dataset and decision tree classifier on UNSW-NB15 dataset as the feature selection technique. © 2023 University of Bahrain.

	abstract = {Distributed cloud computing and its reliance on internet connectivity have more challenges. They offer a great deal of flexibility, and these assets are accessible through the Internet using popular requirements, forms, and protocols for networking according to the cloud service-providing organizations. Attacks like distributed denial of service are a few of the most frequent attacks that severely harm the cloud and lower its performance. Internal attacks cannot be identified using established methods of detection such as firewalls. The attackers frequently modify their skill strategies, because of the increasing amount of data created and stored, conventional detection techniques are inefficient in identifying novel DDoS attacks. Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are a type of artificial neural network commonly used for function approximation, pattern recognition, and classification tasks. While they have been used in various domains, they are not typically used directly within convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) detection. This paper presents a hybrid model of Radial Basis Function (RBF) and LSTM networks-based approach for DDoS attack detection and mitigation, aiming to enhance the overall security of cloud computing infrastructures. Our proposed method is evaluated on benchmark dataset CICDDoS2019, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying DDoS attacks and mitigating their impact on cloud systems. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

Massive connectivity of devices over the cloud allows the unauthorized users to inject malwares. Intrusion attacks are security issues commonly occur in cloud connected systems that create degradation in cloud security. In terms of cloud security, the impacted parameters that involved in the attack scenario is important. The proposed system focused on Brute force FTP attack (BF-FTP), Brute force SSH attack (BF-SSH), DoS attack, DDoS attack, Web attack (WA), Botnet (BN) etc. The novel algorithm is derived through Sailing frog leap-based optimization algorithm for feature mapping, Density weighted boosted regression (DWB) for classification mapping. The Novel hybrid leap boost algorithm (HLB) is formulated here. The proposed approach focused on classification accuracy on specified attacks from labeled IDS2017 dataset. The (CIC) Canadian institute of cyber security dataset is the publicly available reliable dataset on smart city recording. The data is unbalanced in nature. Classification of CIC data with proposed newly innovated HLB process is challenging. The system achieved the accuracy of 91%.

	abstract = {The deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems in smart agriculture (SA) operates in extreme environments, including wind, snowfall, flooding, landscape, and so on for collecting and processing real-time data. The increased connectivity and broad adoption of IoT devices with low-power communications on farmland support farmers in making data-driven decisions using various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Furthermore, in such an environment, edge computing is also utilized to provide computationally intensive, latency-sensitive, and bandwidth-demanding services at the edge of the network. However, protecting edge-to-Things in the extreme environment of SA is challenging, due to the volume of data, and also attackers exploit network gateways to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, we develop a novel deep learning (DL)-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for edge-envisioned SA in extreme environments. Specifically, a hybrid approach is developed by combining bidirectional gated recurrent unit, long-short-term memory with softmax classifier to detect attacks at the edge of the network. To allow faster learning, the proposed IDS employs the truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) approach to handle lengthy sequences of network data. Furthermore, we suggest an attack scenario with deployment architecture for the proposed IDS in the extreme environment of SA. Extensive experiments using three publicly available datasets, namely, CIC-IDS2018, ToN-IoT, and Edge-IIoTset prove the effectiveness of the proposed IDS over some traditional and contemporary state-of-the-art techniques. © 2014 IEEE.},

The landscape of security threats, cyber-attacks, and associated challenges has reached unprecedented sophistication and magnitude. Whether you are an individual, an organization, or a company invested in distributed embedded systems, your paramount concern revolves around protecting invaluable data. In this digital age, data security is genuinely where the wealth resides. This paper introduces a novel framework for securing the sensitive data of distributed embedded systems. The framework comprises five stages, each contributing to an efficient and robust data security approach. Additionally, this work proposes developing an efficient Multiple Attack Detection model using a supervised machine-learning system. The targeted cyber-attacks include phishing, malware, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), and DNS over HTTPS attacks. Each targeted cyber-attack is trained on eight supervised machine learning classifiers. The classifier exhibiting the best overall performance in evaluation metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score) is integrated into the proposed Multiple Attack Detection model. Furthermore, this paper explores deploying a machine learning-based Multiple Attack Detection model to a cloud environment using Streamlit Cloud. © Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management 2024.},

	abstract = {The healthcare sector has a very broad volume of patient information that needs to be recorded, and the cloud provides the necessary infrastructure at a low cost with better quality. The patient health records are implemented as digital output to Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The EHR can contain sensitive patient data such as data, scanned images, and X-rays. Security of the data in the cloud is an important issue due to different kinds of security threats to the cloud, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This study emphasizes the importance of data security in the hybrid cloud for the health sector using encryption with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). We present Data, Speed Efficiency, and Electronics Health Record (DSE), which defines each of the major components required to implement data security in hybrid cloud computing. EHR security is provided by using an encryption technique such as AES, which is implemented and uploaded to the hybrid cloud system. We approach the DSE taxonomy according to its speed and encryption. This study's main contribution is that it establishes a strong link between data security and healthcare organizations, as well as the open issues and challenges for patient data security in the health field. As a recommended solution, EHRs are encrypted with a secret key before uploading to the cloud server. Thus, the data will be safe as it cannot be changed without the help of the data owner and healthcare organizations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has become more familiar in all applications and industrial fields such as medical, military, transportation, etc. It has some limitations because of the attack model in the transmission or communication channel. Moreover, one of the deadliest attacks is known as a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS). The Presence of DDoS in network layer cause huge damage in data transmission channel that ends in data loss or collapse. To address this issue the current research focused on an innovative detection and mitigation of Mirai and DDoS attack in IoT environment. Initially, number of IoT devices is arranged with the help of a novel Hybrid Strawberry and African Buffalo Optimization (HSBABO). Consequently, the types of DDoS attacks are launched in the developed IoT network. Moreover, the presence of strawberry and African Buffalo fitness is utilized to detect and specify the attack types. Subsequently a novel MCELIECE encryption with Cloud Shield scheme is developed to prevent the low and high rate DDoS attack in the Internet of Things. Finally, the proposed model attained 94% of attack detection accuracy, 3% of false negative rate and 5.5% of false positive rate. © 2021, International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is the most useful computing technology for the new service progression. Due to the distributed nature of cloud computing, security threats and cyber attacks are major problems that penetrate the network and cause sudden harm to the financial and business accounts by affecting the servers. Commonly, the vigorous and stable growth of cloud computing is mainly affected due to the security issues in a cloud computing environment. Various malware variants generate cyberattacks. Thus, intrusion detection technology is employed for securing cloud computing from malicious attacks. Cloud Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) identifies malicious attack behavior and guarantees the security and reliability of cloud computing. But, virtual network flow is uncontrollable and unnoticeable among the virtual machines. This paper proposes a novel Gannet Optimization Algorithm-based hybrid Support vector Machine-Extreme Learning Machine (GOA-optimized hybrid SVM-ELM) technique to identify and prevent malicious attacks in a cloud computing atmosphere. Gannet Optimization Algorithm (GOA) optimizer is adopted for selecting optimal features and for minimizing the loss of information. The parameters of the hybrid SVM-ELM model are optimized by the GOA algorithm. The proposed architecture improves the overall security and performance of a cloud-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This proposed technique is used for classifying the different attacks like Normal, web attack, Brute Force, Infiltration, Portscan, DoS/DDoS, and Botnet ARES and is executed using Matlab through employing the CICIDS2017 dataset, and the evidence detection in cloud forensics dataset. The results revealed that high precision, F-Measure, and recall rate are obtained in this technique. Then the training time decreased to 389 ms on the evidence detection in the cloud forensics dataset and 399 ms on the CICIDS2017 dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.},

	abstract = {The Internet is now a crucial aspect of our lives, and distributed computing has grown significantly in size, capability, and complexity, becoming an essential element of our daily lives. There are numerous vulnerabilities in distributed network computing, including viruses, worms, distributed denial of service (DDoS), DoS, and more. One of the more newsworthy attacks recently has been distributed denial-of-service attacks. Attacks that cause denials of service (DoS) have developed and had an influence on the Internet infrastructure. A DDoS attack aims to prevent the targeted users from accessing a computer resource. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive survey of detecting DDoS packets via couple of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Descent, decision tree, Multi-layer Perceptron, and radial basis function using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. We also combine all our machine learning models into one hybrid model via an ensemble classifier. After that, we experiment with a DDoS attack on a local server via Ufonet and capture the data packets during the attack using the Wireshark tool. The captured data will be converted to a CSV file and can be given as input to machine learning models. The results show that each machine learning algorithm is predicting DDoS packets incoming into the server. The experimental results show that the proposed DDoS attack detection method based on machine learning has a good detection rate for the current popular DDoS attack. Finally, directions for future research work have been pointed out. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {The worldwide infrastructure facilitator for corporations and home customers today is cloud computing. Cloud infrastructure provides infinite consistency in the computing power, storage, and network bandwidth in order for them to satisfy the demands of operation in an optimal manner. Cloud computing allows technology firms, internet suppliers, and home consumers to consistently minimize investments and implementation expenditures. Increased use of cloud-based technology by multinational businesses located in offices, remote areas, and home users was also motivated by the proximity to fast speed connectivity and internet access. This chapter focuses on the creation of a detailed and stable networking architecture to minimize the attacks on hybrid clouds by the distributed denial of service. The writers first published an investigation into cybersecurity problems and the effect on cloud environments. The authors analyzed the study of cloud infrastructure, denial of service, and malware identification and mitigation methods released between January 2010 and December 2020. Current strategies to prevent distributed service denial attacks were tested by the authors. The authors then developed and introduced a stable framework for networks that mitigates distributed service denial attacks on hybrid cloud environments. The proposed infrastructures and the findings contrasted with the single data center architectural architecture were carried out at the network- and device-level assaults. This chapter further discusses future study directions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In the cloud computing platform, DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-service) attacks are one of the most commonly occurring attacks. Research studies on DDoS mitigation rarely considered the data shift problem in real-time implementation. Concurrently, existing studies have attempted to perform DDoS attack detection. Nevertheless, they have been deficient regarding the detection rate. Hence, the proposed study proposes a novel DDoS mitigation scheme using LCDT-M (Log-Cluster DDoS Tree Mitigation) framework for the hybrid cloud environment. LCDT-M detects and mitigates DDoS attacks in the Software-Defined Network (SDN) based cloud environment. The LCDT-M comprises three algorithms: GFS (Greedy Feature Selection), TLMC (Two Log Mean Clustering), and DM (Detection-Mitigation) based on DT (Decision Tree) to optimize the detection of DDoS attacks along with mitigation in SDN. The study simulated the defined cloud environment and considered the data shift problem during the real-time implementation. As a result, the proposed architecture achieved an accuracy of about 99.83%, confirming its superior performance. © 2023, Modern Education and Computer Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) is the key outcome of extensive research efforts over the past few decades toward transforming the Internet infrastructure to be more programmable, configurable, and manageable. However, critical cyber-Threats in the SDN-based cloud environment are rising rapidly, in which distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one of the most damaging cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution to tackle DDoS attacks in the SDN-based cloud environment. We first introduce a new hybrid machine learning model based on support vector machine and self-organizing map algorithms to improve the traffic classification. Then, we propose an enhanced history-based IP filtering scheme (eHIPF) to improve the attack detection rate and speed. Finally, we introduce a novel mechanism that combines both the hybrid machine learning model and the eHIPF scheme to make a DDoS attack defender for the SDN-based cloud environment. The testbed is implemented in an SDN-based cloud with service function chaining. Through practical experiments, the proposed DDoS attack defender is proven to outperform existing mechanisms for DDoS attack classification and detection. The comprehensive experiments conducted with various DDoS attack levels prove that the proposed mechanism is an effective, innovative approach to defend DDoS attacks in the SDN-based cloud. © 2013 IEEE.},

Security of cloud-based applications, especially for those applications with constant inbound and outbound user traffic is important. It becomes of the utmost importance to secure the data flowing between the cloud application and user systems against cyber criminals who launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Existing research related to cloud security focuses on securing the flow of information on servers or between networks but there is a lack of research to mitigate Distributed Denial of Service attacks on cloud environments as presented by Buyya et al. and Fachkha, et al. In this article, the authors propose an algorithm and a Hybrid Cloudbased Secure Architecture to mitigate DDoS attacks. By proposing a three-tier cloud infrastructure with a two-tier defense system for separate Network and Application layers, the authors show that DDoS attacks can be detected and blocked before reaching the infrastructure hosting the Cloud applications. © 2020 by IGI Global.

Also, to speed up the entire process, it is also required to choose specific algorithms for the encryption of the data. This paper presents a hybrid solution to the selection of algorithms for encryption. Data duplication is also one of the major concerns in cloud computing. If the duplication rate is very high then it is turned as DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) which results into a huge waste of resources. This paper is also concerned about the identification and removal of the DDoS attack. For the same purpose, Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm has been used. An enhanced genetic algorithm for the minimization of unused data bit patterns to prevent the user from the additional costs is also proposed. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is integrated lots of computing resources which are provided to users over the Internet on a Pay-As-You-Go mode. While multi-tenants and resources sharing are its advantages under the cloud computing environment, it also brings new risks in information security. One of the more difficult consequences of an attack is a flooding attack. This attack is to exhaust the network bandwidth and the computing resources of the server, causing the server to fail to provide services due to heavy workload and may affect the normal service. Other servers in the same infrastructure cause unpredictable losses. Based on the existing DDoS detection technology, this paper proposes a prevention mechanism based on feature selection and random forest classification models to detect hybrid flooding attacks, called HFADS. The HFADS scheme is mainly divided into three modules: (1) Resource Monitor Module (2) Data Features Selection Module (3) Machine Learning Evaluation Module. Based on the above three modules, we perform some simulations for HFADS to be compared with Mouhammd Alkasassbeh et al.’s method to detect flooding attacks of DDoS in terms of three KPIs including recall rate, accuracy rate and average processing time. The final experimental results indicate that HFADS can achieve 99.99% for UDP, 99.95% for ICMP and 99.99% for HTTP in recall rate, 99.98% in accuracy rate and 65.34 seconds in average processing time. Consequently, the proposed HFADS is more effective and efficient than Mouhammd Alkasassbeh et al.’s method for the identification of hybrid flooding attacks. © 2019 IEEE.},

Cloud computing provides infrastructure, platform, software, and other hybrid models as pay-as-you go based services. Customers pay based on usage of particular utility. There are vulnerabilities in the cloud infrastructure which have been easily exploited by the attackers. The well-known Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is the most eminent attack in this area of computing. DDoS attacks compromise the services of the cloud servers by overwhelming it with huge volume of normal or incomplete traffic making difficult to respond further to the legitimate clients. In cloud computing, virtual machines are created which run through instances. OpenStack is one such cloud platform, which is Open Source and is mostly deployed as Infrastructure as a service (IAAS). This paper presents experimental evaluation of DDoS attack on OpenStack cloud platform. The experimentation was conducted on open source platform of OpenStack as private cloud model. AnonymousDoser, LOIC, and Slowloris were used to launch DDoS attack. These tools flood the cloud with TCP/IP and HTTP packets. Finally, different traffic analysis tools are used to analyze the traffic pattern. The analysis is done on the basis of parameters like resource utilization of CPU, memory and packet drop. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The data collected can be stored, for example, into private, public, or hybrid cloud service infrastructure or distributed service by utilizing data platforms. The stored data can be used when implementing services, such as building automation (BAS). Cloud services, IoT sensors, and data platforms can face several kinds of cybersecurity attack vectors such as adversarial, AI-based, DoS/DDoS, insider attacks. If a perpetrator can penetrate the defenses of a data platform, she can cause significant harm to the system. For example, the perpetrator can disrupt a building’s automatic heating system or break the heating equipment by using a suitable attack vector for a data platform. This chapter focuses on examining possibilities to protect cloud storage or data platforms from incoming cyberattacks by using, for instance, artificial-intelligence-based tools or trained neural networks that can detect and prevent typical attack vectors. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are the main threats to cloud computing, and it is therefore crucial to protect against these types of intrusive attack. In this chapter, the effective monitoring of security by a hybrid intrusion detection system (H-IDS) in the virtual network layer of cloud computing technology is discussed and a detailed view of insider and outsider attackers in the virtual network layer is provided. This framework splits into four layers, namely virtual machine layer, node layer, cloud cluster layer, and cloud layer. Signature and anomaly techniques are used to detect known as well as unknown attacks and all virtual machine (VM) host systems which are available in the cloud computing environment are considered. The cloud cluster layer uses a correlation module (CM) to detect distributed attacks, and the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) is employed in the final decision-making phase of the intrusion detection system (IDS) in order to improve its accuracy. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the area of cloud security, detection of DDoS attack is a challenging task such that legitimate users use the cloud resources properly. So in this paper, detection and classification of the attacking packets and normal packets are done by using various machine learning classifiers. We have selected the most relevant features from NSL KDD dataset using five (Information gain, gain ratio, chi-squared, ReliefF, and symmetrical uncertainty) commonly used feature selection methods. Now from the entire selected feature set, the most important features are selected by applying our hybrid feature selection method. Since all the anomalous instances of the dataset do not belong to DDoS category so we have separated only the DDoS packets from the dataset using the selected features. Finally, the dataset has been prepared and named as KDD DDoS dataset by considering the selected DDoS packets and normal packets. This KDD DDoS dataset has been discretized using discretize tool in weka for getting better performance. Finally, this discretize dataset has been applied on some commonly used (Naive Bayes, Bayes Net, Decision Table, J48 and Random Forest) classifiers for determining the detection rate of the classifiers. 10 fold cross validation has been used here for measuring the robustness of the system. To measure the efficiency of our hybrid feature selection method, we have also applied the same set of classifiers on the NSL KDD dataset, where it gives the best anomaly detection rate of 99.72% and average detection rate 98.47% similarly, we have applied the same set of classifiers on NSL DDoS dataset and obtain the average DDoS detection of 99.01% and the best DDoS detection rate of 99.86%. In order to compare the performance of our proposed hybrid method, we have also applied the existing feature selection methods and measured the detection rate using the same set of classifiers. Finally, we have seen that our hybrid approach for detecting the DDoS attack gives the best detection rate compared to some existing methods. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud-based services are increasing day by day for various purposes due to its perpetuity and diverse dexterity. However, offensive network traffic such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) plays a significant role in threatening the cloud-based services. Therefore, defense for such attacks is required to save the cloud resources. Most of the attribute selection approaches for request classification are based on static threshold statistics. These statistics are the default values used to reduce the dimensionality of data. However, these default statistics do not work well with varying network conditions and for different intensities of DDoS attack. Therefore, an adaptive statistic is required to deal with different network and incoming traffic conditions. This paper also gives an comprehensive analysis of TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol-based DDoS attack and its effects on the cloud network. Based on the analysis and above issues, this paper presents an adaptive hybrid approach for attribute selection and classification of incoming traffic. The proposed approach consists of three subsystems such as (1) preprocessing subsystem, (2) adaptive attribute selection subsystem and (3) detection and prevention subsystem. The work utilizes NSL-KDD dataset which helps in the evaluation of the proposed approach. It is concluded that the combination of Mean Absolute Deviation technique with Random Forest classifier (MAD-RF) outperforms the other combinations. Therefore, MAD-RF is selected for further analysis. MAD-RF is also capable of dealing with TCP, UDP and ICMP protocol-based DDoS attack. The result shows that MAD-RF outperforms dimensionality reduction, traditional attribute selection methods and state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.},

It interrelates various applications like sales, purchase, banking, customer service, etc. and it behaves entirely as a service-oriented platform or environment. The primary objective of the cloud computing is sharing the resources within increased efficiency regarding time and cost for all kind of customers who needs a cloud service badly and immediately. Though the energy is high, it cannot assure that the cloud computing, service providing, and customer maintenance are highly secured. Service providers in the cloud are not strictly public; it may be private, community and hybrid. Malicious activities can be created or occurred in the middle of the communication and it is difficult to predict a particular person in the middle becomes a malicious user, from where and how. Secured data transmission and discussion in cloud computing considered as the main problem, and various earlier research works focused on tightening the security. The primary objective of this paper is to discuss different security mechanisms applied to multiple malicious threats in the cloud to understand the various issues and challenges faced in earlier research works. It provides a summary of the risks, appropriate method and the limitations and it helps to understand the primary and main problems related to security. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {Cloud environment is an assembly of resources for furnishing on-demand services to cloud customers. Here access to cloud environment is via internet services in which data stored on cloud environment are easier to both internal and external intruders. To detect intruders, various intrusion detection systems and authentication systems was proposed in earlier researches which are primarily ineffective. Many existing researchers were concentrated on machine learning approaches for detecting intrusions using fuzzy clustering, artificial neural network, support vector machine, fuzzy with neural network and etc., which are not furnishing predominant results based on detection rate and false negative rates. Our proposed system directed on intrusion detection system and it uses cloudlet controller, trust authority and virtual machine management in cloud environment. We propose two novel algorithms such as (i) packet scrutinization algorithm which examines the packets from the users and (ii) hybrid classification model called “NK-RNN” which is a combination of normalized K-means clustering algorithm with recurrent neural network. For preventing the user from intruders, we propose a one time signature for cloud user in order to access the data on cloud environment. Our proposed classifier effectively detects the intruders which are experimentally proved by comparing with existing classification models. Thus our proposed results are expressed by packet loss ratio, average packet delay, throughput, detection rate, false positive rate and false negative rate. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Background & Objective: Detecting and mitigating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is a serious problem. In addition, new features and network deployments such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN) may open the door for new threats that did not previously exist. Recent publications and patent are reviewed to find new techniques developed for integrating different mechanisms to secure networks against DDoS. Methods: This work presents a simple model for integrating different mechanisms to secure both SDN and legacy network in a hybrid cloud environment, it is called FocusON. It aims at mitigating DDoS attacks of a victim network. In addition, separating network monitoring from its control aims at mitigating DDoS attacks of a victim network. Traffic pattern analysis is apart from attack detection mechanism that gives a conceptual representation of a specific kind of DDoS attacks. DDoS detection is a completely automated process. Once called, for the reaction, the active response will be tak-en against the real IP source of the attacker. The communication time overhead was tested in order to evaluate the remote server response time in case of deploying our proposed model mechanisms and without our proposed model. Here we introduce a response mechanism that consists of an analysis of event logs, traffic patterns, and IP traceback. The proposed model categorizes the underlying network according to the location into a victim network and the source of attack (public cloud). Results & Conclusion: The proposed model implemented in a hybrid cloud environment using the network of SDN and legacy network. The experimental setup was built using our network lab connected to the Amazon public cloud. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing is technologically the emerging trend of providing computational resources on demand, may that be storage, network or computation, it encompasses all. The resources can be provided by private, public or a hybrid cloud. Cloud computing is the future of computing and is struggling with the concern of security. Among all security concerns, the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is one of the biggest threats to both Internet Security and to Cloud as well. A sizable amount of bots is indulged in the creation of DDoS attacks on a Cloud target by flooding them with malformed packets to exhaust the resources. On the other hand, Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) is a new threat to Cloud security which exploits the cloud elasticity and auto-scaling features and charges the user way too high; thus making economically a theft in it. Public cloud is less prone to attacks as they have inbuilt load balancers and mitigation setups. A private cloud like Eucalyptus is more vulnerable to DDoS attacks as they have lesser defense setups. To overcome these issues we propose a system of DDoS mitigation using Snort for DDoS detection and Packet Filtering IP-Tables in Private cloud set up of Eucalyptus. It acts as our defensive front. This way, our cloud gets saved from DDoS attack without it being burdened with the excess traffic. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), several devices like sensors nowadays can interact and easily share information. But the IoT model is prone to security concerns as several attackers try to hit the network and make it vulnerable. In such scenarios, security concern is the most prominent. Different models were intended to address these security problems; still, several emergent variants of botnet attacks like Bashlite, Mirai, and Persirai use security breaches. The malware classification and detection in the IoT model is still a problem, as the adversary reliably generates a new variant of IoT malware and actively searches for compromise on the victim devices. This article develops a Sine Cosine Algorithm with Deep Learning based Ransomware Detection and Classification (SCADL-RWDC) method in an IoT environment. In the presented SCADL-RWDCtechnique, the major intention exists in recognizing and classifying ransomware attacks in the IoT platform. The SCADL-RWDC technique uses the SCA feature selection (SCA-FS) model to improve the detection rate. Besides, the SCADL-RWDC technique exploits the hybrid grey wolf optimizer (HGWO) with a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model for ransomware classification. A widespread experimental analysis is performed to exhibit the enhanced ransomware detection outcomes of the SCADL-RWDC technique. The comparison study reported the enhancement of the SCADL-RWDC technique over other models. © 2023 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Machine learning approaches are widely used for the detection and classification of emerging botnet variations due to their ability to yield more precise results compared to traditional methods. The relevancy of the features plays a major role in these detection algorithms' effectiveness. As such, the most distinctive characteristics must be extracted from a high-dimensional dataset that is used to classify botnets. Nevertheless, we discovered that the majority of earlier studies lacked proper analysis and paid little attention to the various feature selection techniques. The main goal of this work is to investigate and assess the advantages and disadvantages of the different feature selection techniques used for botnet detection. Studies show that feature selection is a very efficient way to decrease the amount of storage and processing power required while simultaneously increasing classification accuracy. As a consequence, its application in many other fields has grown. The field of feature selection is recognized for its non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness; to mitigate this hardness, metaheuristic techniques have been applied. Metaheuristic algorithms are exceptionally good at performing a global search. In order to choose feature subsets optimally in the field of botnet detection, we additionally prioritize the use of metaheuristic methods. This study offers a more thorough insight of the feature selection strategies that are primarily employed by machine learning-based botnet detection models. It also offers insights into how better feature selection approaches might be applied to strengthen botnet detection mechanisms. Additionally, it will help in understanding the limitations of existing approaches and identifying areas for improvement. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (loT) devices can be extensively utilized by several industries containing smart farming, smart logistics, smart medicine, smart cities, and so on. But, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) outbreaks position is a critical attack to IoT safety. Attackers simply employ the vulnerabilities of IoT devices and they control a portion of botnets to introduce DDoS attacks. IoT devices can be limited resources with restricted memory and calculating resources. While a developing technology, Blockchain (BC) has a great to resolving the security problems from the IoT. As a result, it can be essential to analyze distinct BC-based solutions for mitigating DDoS attacks from the IoT. This study develops Enhanced Metaheuristics with Deep Learning Model for BC Assisted Cybersecurity Solution (EMDLM-BCCS) technique in IoT platform. To allow secure data transmission from the IoT networks, BC technology can be applied. The EMDLM-BCCS algorithm follows initial stage of data pre-processing to normalize the input data. For attack detection, the EMDLM-BCCS approach makes use of extreme learning machine (ELM) approach. To enhance the detection results of the ELM model, elite-oppositional grasshopper optimization algorithm (EGOA) can be utilized. The simulated value of the EMDLM-BCCS approach can be validated on BoT-IoT dataset. The obtained values infer the better solution of the EMDLM-BCCS algorithm in terms of different measures. © 2024 IEEE.},

Several Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods for detecting botnet (BN) assaults in IoT networks have recently been proposed. However, in the training set, severely imbalanced network traffic data degrades the classification performances of state-of-the-art ML as well as DL algorithm, particularly in classes with very few samples. The Convolutional Neural Network -Pelican Optimization System (CNN-POA) is a DL relied botnet attack detection algorithm developed in this research. Meanwhile, typical evaluation markers are used to compare the overall performance of the proposed CNN-POA and additional frequently employed algorithms. The simulation results suggest that the CNN-POA method is effective and dependable for detecting IoT network intrusion attacks.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is developing as a novel phenomenon that is applied in the growth of several crucial applications. However, these applications continue to function on a centralized storage structure, which leads to several major problems, such as security, privacy, and a single point of failure. In recent years, blockchain (BC) technology has become a pillar for the progression of IoT-based applications. The BC technique is utilized to resolve the security, privacy, and single point of failure (third-part dependency) issues encountered in IoT applications. Conversely, the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on mining pools revealed the existence of vital fault lines amongst the BC-assisted IoT networks. Therefore, the current study designs a hybrid Harris Hawks with sine cosine and a deep learning-based intrusion detection system (H3SC-DLIDS) for a BC-supported IoT environment. The aim of the presented H3SC-DLIDS approach is to recognize the presence of DDoS attacks in the BC-assisted IoT environment. To enable secure communication in the IoT networks, BC technology is used. The proposed H3SC-DLIDS technique designs a H3SC technique by integrating the concepts of Harris Hawks optimization (HHO) and sine cosine algorithm (SCA) for feature selection. For the intrusion detection process, a long short-term memory auto-encoder (LSTM-AE) model is utilized in this study. Finally, the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) is implemented for hyperparameter tuning of the LSTM-AE technique. The proposed H3SC-DLIDS method was experimentally validated using the BoT-IoT database, and the results indicate the superior performance of the proposed H3SC-DLIDS technique over other existing methods, with a maximum accuracy of 99.05%. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, software defined networking (SDN) has risen to prominence as a cutting-edge and promising networking approach. SDN is more secure and immune to DDoS attacks than traditional networks due to the bifurcation of the control and data planes, a global perspective of the whole network, centralized network control, and many other features. SDN still seems to be vulnerable to new DDoS attacks that can target the Application plane, control plane, or data plane, as well as the SDN architectural communication channels. In this paper, we propose a novel optimized weighted voting ensemble model to detect DDoS attack in an SDN environment. The proposed ensemble employs six base classifiers (two SVMs, two Random forests, and two Gradient Boosted Machines) that are differentiated by hyperparameter values. The optimal set of weights are identified by a novel hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm (BHO). Our approach eliminates false negatives by employing a novel dynamic fitness function. For training the ensemble framework we used CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. To examine the proposed model's performance, a testbed is developed using mininet and POX controller and loaded with multiple datasets. Our model outperforms all the recent approaches, achieving a low variance and high classification accuracies of 99.4163% and 99.3591% on CIC-DDoS2019 and CAIDA-2007 datasets respectively. © 2021},

	abstract = {Security is a crucial factor in the continuously evolving programmable networks. With the emergence of programmable networking terminals, the need to protect the networks has become mandatory. Software-defined networks (SDNs) provide programmable switches, thereby isolating the data plane from the control plane. Many security algorithms have been proposed to protect the network; however, they have failed to protect SDNs from attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), jamming, and man-in-the-middle attacks. In this article, we only address the DDoS attack that prevails in SDNs. Isolation of the control plane from the data plane increases the probability of an attack on the data plane. Therefore, a framework that can handle the dynamic traffic and can protect the network from DDoS attacks is required. Our proposed whale optimization algorithm–based clustering for DDoS detection (WOA-DD) avoids the DDoS attacks using a metaheuristic approach by clustering the attack requests. We evaluated this algorithm for robustness in comparison with several existing solutions and found it to be safe under several conditions. The proposed attack request clustering is explored to check its feasibility with various machine learning approaches and found to be stable with the prevailing mechanisms. Analysis of the algorithm under varied conditions reveals that WOA-DD is robust, stable, and efficient against DDoS attacks. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of interconnected physical devices that are embedded with software, sensors, etc., allowing them to exchange and collect information. Although IoT devices have several advantages and can improve people’s efficacy, they also pose a security risk. The malicious actor frequently attempts to find a new way to utilize and exploit specific resources, and an IoT device is an ideal candidate for such exploitation owing to the massive number of active devices. Especially, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks include the exploitation of a considerable number of devices like IoT devices, which act as bots and transfer fraudulent requests to the services, thereby obstructing them. There needs to be a robust system of detection based on satisfactory methods for detecting and identifying whether these attacks have occurred or not in a network. The most widely used technique for these purposes is artificial intelligence (AI), which includes the usage of Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) to find cyberattacks. The study presents a Piecewise Harris Hawks Optimizer with an Optimal Deep Learning Classifier (PHHO-ODLC) for a secure IoT environment. The fundamental goal of the PHHO-ODLC algorithm is to detect the existence of DDoS attacks in the IoT platform. The PHHO-ODLC method follows a three-stage process. At the initial stage, the PHHO algorithm can be employed to choose relevant features and thereby enhance the classification performance. Next, an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (ABiLSTM) network can be applied to the DDoS attack classification process. Finally, the hyperparameter selection of the ABiLSTM network is carried out by the use of a grey wolf optimizer (GWO). A widespread simulation analysis was performed to exhibit the improved detection accuracy of the PHHO-ODLC technique. The extensive outcomes demonstrated the significance of the PHHO-ODLC technique regarding the DDoS attack detection technique in the IoT platform. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, there are ample amounts of Internet of Things (IoT) devices interconnected to the networks, and with technological improvement, cyberattacks and security threads, for example, botnets, are rapidly evolving and emerging with high-risk attacks. A botnet is a network of compromised devices that are controlled by cyber attackers, frequently employed to perform different cyberattacks. Such attack disrupts IoT evolution by disrupting services and networks for IoT devices. Detecting botnets in an IoT environment includes finding abnormal patterns or behaviors that might indicate the existence of these malicious networks. Several researchers have proposed deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches for identifying and categorizing botnet attacks in the IoT platform. Therefore, this study introduces a Botnet Detection using the Chaotic Binary Pelican Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning (BNT-CBPOADL) technique in the IoT environment. The main aim of the BNT-CBPOADL method lies in the correct detection and categorization of botnet attacks in the IoT environment. In the BNT-CBPOADL method, Z-score normalization is applied for pre-processing. Besides, the CBPOA technique is derived for feature selection. The convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) method is applied for botnet detection. At last, the arithmetical optimization algorithm (AOA) is employed for the optimal hyperparameter tuning of the CVAE algorithm. The experimental valuation of the BNT-CBPOADL technique is tested on a Bot-IoT database. The experimentation outcomes inferred the supremacy of the BNT-CBPOADL method over other existing techniques with maximum accuracy of 99.50%. © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Vehicle malfunctions have a direct impact on both human and road safety, making vehicle network security an important and critical challenge. Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have grown to be indispensable in recent years for enabling intelligent transport systems, guaranteeing traffic safety, and averting collisions. However, because of numerous types of assaults, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Denial of Service (DoS), VANETs have significant difficulties. A powerful Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) is required to overcome these security issues. This research presents an innovative method for creating an AI-based NIDS that uses Deep Learning methods. The suggested model specifically incorporates the Self Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SA-BiLSTM) for classification and the Cascaded Convolution Neural Network (CCNN) for learning high-level features. The Multi-variant Gradient-Based Optimization algorithm (MV-GBO) is applied to improve CCNN and SA-BiLSTM further to enhance the model's performance. Additionally, information gained using MV-GBO-based feature extraction is employed to enhance feature learning. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on reliable datasets such as KDD-CUP99, ToN-IoT, and VeReMi, which are utilized on the MATLAB platform. The proposed model achieved 99% accuracy on all the datasets.},

	abstract = {The centralization of control and programmability in Software-Defined networking (SDN) have enhanced network functionality, but they have also made it vulnerable to security threats like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which may target both the data and control planes. To detect and mitigate the DDoS attacks in SDN’s control plane, a novel attack detection model is proposed in this research. The proposed model is developed utilizing Deep Learning (DL) and metaheuristic optimization algorithms. The key objective of this research is to classify and detect the attacks in SDN’s control plane layer. The proposed model, SDN-Intrusion Detection System (SDN-IDS), includes four main phases: data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection and classification. Initially, the InSDN dataset is collected to train and evaluate the research model. The data preprocessing phase includes data cleaning, data transformation, and normalization processes. After preprocessing, a Binary variant of the Ant Lion Optimizer (BALO) algorithm is used for selecting optimal features from the input dataset. Based on the selected features, the Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (ABiLSTM) model is implemented for classification. To improve the classification accuracy of the ABiLSTM model, the Bayesian Optimization (BO) technique is applied for hyperparameter tuning. The SDN-IDS model is assessed in terms of detection rate, accuracy, f1-score, FAR, and precision. Based on this analysis, the model attained 99.61% accuracy, 99.53% detection rate, 99.70% precision, 99.58% f1-score, and 0.46% FAR. Overall, these results indicate that the proposed SDN-IDS model effectively detects and classifies DDoS attacks within the SDN control layer with higher accuracy while maintaining a low FAR compared to the existing models. © 2024 Seventh Sense Research Group®.},

It results in various issues such as illegal access, data leakage, data stolen, DDoS attacks, etc. To overcome such issues, several intrusion detection systems are implemented over the past years. Though, these intrusion detection systems exhibit several limitations while trying to achieve excellent efficiency in attack detection. In this survey, totally 50 cyber-attack detection based research works are analysed under several perspectives. The analysis is done on several IDS techniques implemented in existing works. The reviewed learning-based approaches are explained in two major categories as ML and DL approaches. Here, the ML algorithms are further classified into three types: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning approaches. Moreover, the existing works are also analysed in accordance with optimization algorithms and it is classified as metaheuristic and stochastic algorithms. In which, population-based algorithms and swarm-based algorithms are the categories classified under metaheuristic algorithms. In addition, the analyses are also performed on datasets usage and cyber-attack mitigation models. Furthermore, the analysis on existing works is done on performance analysis. And it is analysed under performance of cyber-attack detection models with specific description about maximum and minimum performance attained by recent works on cyber-attack detection models.

	abstract = {The rise of the internet of things (IoT) popularity with smart home systems and improvements in the technologies of embedded devices raised interest in such solutions. However, with the increase in the utilization of these technologies, the security risks increased as well. Connecting a large number of devices to the same network is risky, because the security of any network is only as strong as its weakest part, and in the case of IoT the weakest link can be a small home appliance. This research aims to improve the means for detecting and preventing attacks on such networks via a hybrid method between machine learning and population-based metaheuristics. The proposed study introduces an enhanced version of the recently emerged sine cosine algorithm (SCA) that was used for tuning extreme learning machine (ELM). The hybrid method was validated against the UNSW-NB15 dataset that consists of features that describe regular (normal) and botnet traffic, where the latter refers to the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The hybrid framework’s performance metrics were compared with several other classic machine learning models, as well as with other ELM solutions tuned by other population-based metaheuristics. Based on experimental data, the conclusion that the proposed method on average obtains the best performance can be derived. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.},

	abstract = {Technologies that enable physical objects to communicate with each other are attracting a lot of interest day by day. Internet of Things (IoT) is a communication network that is used to connect with technological devices and systems. The growth of IoT networks has led to malicious targeting of these systems by third parties. To prevent such malicious purposes, network security should be at the forefront. Recently, artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used in security domains. Two accessible datasets were used in this study. The datasets consist of simulated bot IoT network traffic data containing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack types. In the proposed approach, probabilistic Bayesian neural networks and normal Bayesian neural networks are used as the deep learning models. All features of the dataset were trained using two models. Then, the datasets were optimized using hunger games search (HGS) method and the most efficient parameters of the datasets were selected and retrained using deep learning models. In the analysis performed using the proposed approach, an overall accuracy of 100% was obtained for the dataset used in the first experiment and 99.99% for the dataset used in the second experiment. It was also observed that metaheuristic optimization helps the proposed approach to save time in detecting DDoS attacks. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Trust enabled wireless networks use temporal behaviour information of nodes in order to classify them into different trust categories. This information is utilized by the router for high performance communication that is optimized in terms of end-to-end delay, energy consumption, throughput, packet delivery ratio, and other quality of service (QoS) parameters. Establishing security in trust enabled wireless networks is a difficult task, because high trust nodes might be compromised by external or internal attacks, thereby disrupting normal communication. In order to perform this task, blockchain based security models are deployed. These models provide high transparency, comprehensive traceability, distributed processing, and data immutability, which makes them highly deployable for trust enabled networks. Blockchain models enforce compulsive verification of data before communication, which makes them resilient to DDoS, MITM, denial of service, and other data-based attacks. In order to enforce these checks, each of the block is hashed, and the hash values are compared with every existing block in the chain. These checks include hash uniqueness, and hash pattern validations; the later of which is decided by the network designer(s). As the length of blockchain increases, computational complexity of adding a new block (a.k.a. blockchain mining) increases exponentially, which adds to the end-to-end delay, and energy consumption of wireless nodes, which is a drawback of these models. To avoid this, sidechains blockchain sharding models are developed. These models work by dividing the existing blockchain into multiple parts (based on a certain pre-set criteria), and then use the parts for high speed and low power mining. But again, due to increase in number of sidechains, the computational complexity of managing these chains, and locating data blocks within them increases exponentially. Moreover, in any practical wireless network, there is a need to communicate modifiable data, which is not supported by current blockchain implementations. In order to resolve these issues, this text proposes a transformable blockchain sharding model, which is managed via a light weight meta heuristic method for high-speed data access. The proposed model aims at reducing computational complexity of sidechain maintenance with the help of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for storing of hash ranges. The model also incorporates a transformable blockchain solution, wherein the block structure is designed to incorporate selectively mutable as well as non-mutable information. Both the mutable and non-mutable information is encrypted using high performance elliptic curve cryptosystem, which makes it highly secure against network attacks. The proposed model showcases 15% improvement in network lifetime, 8% reduction in end-to-end delay, 22% reduction in computational complexity, and 18% improvement in network throughput when compared with various blockchain and sidechain based wireless networks, thereby assisting in development of a high QoS and highly secure wireless network. © 2023 - IOS Press.

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of network technologies and protocols has fueled the widespread endorsement of the Internet of Things (IoT) in numerous domains, including everyday life, healthcare, industries, agriculture, and more. However, this rapid growth has also given rise to numerous security concerns within IoT systems. Consequently, privacy and security have become paramount issues in the IoT framework. Due to the heterogeneous data produced by smart IoT devices, traditional intrusion detection system doesn't work well with IoT system. The massive volume of heterogeneous data has several irrelevant, redundant, and unnecessary features which lead to high computation time and low accuracy of IDS. Therefore, to tackle these challenges, this paper presents a novel metaheuristic-based IDS model for the IoT systems. The chaotic opposition -based Harris Hawk optimization (CO-IHHO) algorithm is used to perform the feature selection of data traffic. The chosen features are subsequently inputted into a machine learning (ML) classifier to detect network traffic intrusions. The performance of the CO-IHHO based IDS model is verified against the BoT-IoT dataset. Experimental findings reveal that CO-IHHO-DT achieves the maximal accuracy of 99.65\% for multiclass classification and 100\% for binary classification, and minimal computation time of 31.34 sec for multiclass classification and 133.54 sec for binary classification.},
